<p class='c010'>FEDERAL BOARD OF HOSPITALIZATION.</p>

<p class='c010'>TO THE HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND ESTABLISHMENTS:</p>

<p class='c010'>1. For the purpose of coordinating the
separate hospitalization activities of the
Medical Department of the Army, the Bureau of
Medicine and Surgery of the Navy, the Public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Health Service, St. Elizabeths’ Hospital, the
National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers,
the Office of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
and the United States Veterans’ Bureau,
there is hereby organized a Federal Board of
Hospitalization.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The Board shall be composed of the
following officials: An official to be designated
by the President, who shall be known as
Chief Coordinator and who shall be President
of the Board; the Surgeon General of the Army;
the Surgeon General of the Navy; the Surgeon
General of the Public Health Service; the
Superintendent of St. Elizabeths’ Hospital;
the President, Board of Managers, National
Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers; the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs; and the
Director of the United States Veterans’
Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. It shall be the duty of the Board:</p>

<p class='c011'>(a) To consider all questions
relative to the coordination of hospitalization
of the departments represented.</p>

<p class='c011'>(b) To standardize requirements,
to expedite the inter-department use of existing
Government facilities, to eliminate duplication
in the purchase of supplies and the
erection of buildings.</p>

<p class='c011'>(c) To formulate plans designed
to knit together in proper coordination the
activities of the several departments and establishments,
with a view to safeguarding the
interests of the Government and to increasing
the usefulness and efficiency of the several
organizations, and to report to the President
thereon.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. The Chief Coordinator of the Board of
Hospitalization shall preside over the Board and
be responsible for its efficiency and for developing
its activities along practical lines. After
a full discussion of any question by the Board,
the decision of the Chief Coordinator will be final
as to any action to be taken or any policy to be
pursued, but any member may appeal from the decision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to his own immediate superior.</p>

<p class='c010'>From this you will readily see that the extent of the work
under the administration of this Board is very far-reaching
and is an innovation in Federal Hospitalization activities, for
beside being interested in behalf of reasonable economies
in administration, the Federal Board of Hospitalization
is particularly and especially interested in carrying
out the highest ideals of modern hospitalization for
the far advanced Veteran.</p>

<p class='c010'>The President and his administrative family have
in mind, as the basic principle of all hospital service,
the very best that can be supplied, measured by real end-results.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Board of Hospitalization represents all of
the Departments of the Government directing and controlling
the Federal Hospitals of the United States. Each of the
Chiefs of these Departments will speak of his particular relation
to the subject of Hospitalization as it refers to the
World War Veteran, as the program proceeds.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order that each of you may understand the magnitude
of the entire subject of Hospitalization of the World
War Veteran, I wish to present the following facts;</p>

<p class='c010'>Today there are being hospitalized under Government
control, in Federal Hospitals, 22,440 World War Veterans, who
are distributed among the various Departments as follows:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

    <td class='c012'>A total of</td>
    <td class='c006'>22,440</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>This does not take into account patients in contract hospitals
which now number 9,066. This enumeration demonstrates
something of the scope and nature of the work for which the
members of the Board of Hospitalization are responsible.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may interest you to know that there are now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>under construction 7,592 new beds, which will be ready
for occupancy within the next few months and that the Government
is at present contemplating at least 2,500 more
beds under the new Langley Bill, so ultimately the Government
will have under its direct administration hospital
capacity for a minimum of 32,000 patients, which is estimated
to be the peak load.</p>

<p class='c010'>Heretofore there has been no coordinate plan of
operation of these various institutions. Under the Board
of Hospitalization all of this has been changed and today,
you, whether from the Army, Navy, Public Health Service, National
Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers or the Department
of the Interior are all members of one big professional family,
each engaged in the same service, under the same regulations,
for the care and treatment of the World War Veteran.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hospitals engaged in this service number at present
107, distributed as follows:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c014'>These institutions are located in all sections of the United States
from the Atlantic to the Pacific and constitute one of the greatest
hospitalization propositions within the history of any country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The personnel engaged represents an Army of almost as
many more persons. In other words, Uncle Sam, within himself, is
today keeping in operation a hospitalization program incomparable
with anything with which former experiences are familiar.</p>

<p class='c010'>With this representation of the subject and its magnitude,
I wish to remind you that each one of you personally and individually
is a part of this great machine; and upon you rests the responsibility
of the carrying out of such policies as are adopted by the
Central Administration.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order that there might be perfect coordination and cooperation
in all of these hospitals and that all institutions serving
the World War Veteran might be operated upon a standardized basis,
the Board of Hospitalization recently adopted the following regulation
as to personnel:</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p class='c014'>Making a total of 182 employees to every 200 patients, or almost one attendant
and assistant to each patient.</p>

<p class='c010'>This arrangement provides that all patients will have equal care
and attention of such a similar type as to guarantee to all classes of patients
the best of professional, nurse and domiciliary attention that
can be given, no matter in what Department they are being treated.</p>

<p class='c010'>All of the Departments constituting the Board of Hospitalization
are now meeting in joint sessions, wherein they take up in detail
all of the matters pertaining to the welfare of the Veteran Hospitalization
subject. Out of this consideration there is developing
a much better understanding, a more complete system of operation, better
conduct and much better end-results.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the objects of this conference is that you the better
understand by personal contact with each other and with the different
phases of the work, what the business of caring for these veterans in
its entirety means. We know of course that you each have your special
problems, you each have certain affairs within yourselves that keep your
attention very much engaged in the things with which you come personally
in contact, but we thought it would give you a better impression of the
magnitude and importance of the subject if we were to have you here where
those who are responsible for the direction of the affairs of Hospitalization
could meet you individually.</p>

<p class='c010'>We want you to know that we are greatly interested in you and
the service you are rendering. We wish you to feel assured that your interests
are our interests. We wish to impress upon you that the conduct
of the affairs under your administration means the reputation and the historical
record of the Government’s treatment of the World War veteran.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are anxious indeed that you should get from this meeting
inspiration for better work and encouragement in the efforts that you
are putting forth, new ideas with which to meet the great and everchanging
propositions which are before you, closer touch with those who,
like yourselves, are interested in the World War defenders. This accomplished
and each of us will have benefited and the expense of time
and money in your coming here will be justified.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Your contact here should make you bigger and broader men.
If you will take out of the great opportunities that are presented
in the privileges of this meeting, the effects which may be obtained,
we are sure that you will go back to your respective fields
of service better satisfied, more capable and certainly more determined
than ever to render the best service there is within you
under all circumstances and conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems pertinent that I should impress upon you at this
time that no matter what kind of institutions the Government may
possess, how well equipped with apparatus, or how pleasing in location,
without your interest, without the scientific care and attention
which you can provide, without your determination and your loyal
support and action in all of the affairs pertaining to the conduct
of these institutions, they will fail.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, if you will give them the best within
you, if you will keep yourselves professionally and administratively
in the vanguard of such affairs, if you will go whole-heartedly,
persistently and determinedly forward to the carrying out of the
highest ideals your constructive visions can invent, the world
War Veteran will realize that in his Government he has the care and
appreciation of the best Government under the sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>Allow me to again admonish you that upon you individually
and personally rests much of whatever is to come to the present
Administration, either in the form of complaint or of eulogy. To the
end that it may be eulogy, let there ever abide with you the assurance
that the President of the United States and all of his administrative
assistants will be with you heart and soul in everything
that promotes the interest of the rehabilitation of the World War
Veteran. Remember that you owe to your country and to yourselves
that you practice economy, that you deal fairly, that you act squarely
with all of the propositions which come to you. Do not forget
that you should be loyal to the Departments to which you belong,
ever obedient to the orders of your Chiefs; that you be faithful,
earnest and sincere, honest, conscientious and ever active in behalf
of the highest principles connected with the maintenance of the
institution with which you are connected and finally that you be
ever able to register and substantiate yourselves as American
citizens, full of an American spirit, loyal to country and to flag.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you will do these things, you will have the everlasting
gratitude of the President of the United States, you will be entitled
to and will receive the econiums of our dear doughboys and above all
you will have the satisfying consciousness of a noble duty truly
done.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>In order that the business of the conference may be transacted

<p class='c010'>“I have pleasure at this time in introducing to you Colonel
Charles R. Forbes, who will speak to you on the ‘Relation of
the Veterans’ Bureau to all Hospitalization Activities’.”</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL FORBES: Addressed the conference as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Upon the signing of the Armistice on November 11, 1918, there
was immediately commenced the demobilisation of the armed military
and naval forces of the United States, comprising approximately
4,000,000 men and women. As an aftermath of war service from the
result of battle wounds, gassing, injuries and disease it was anticipated
that there would be a large number of men and women who
would be physically disabled, either temporarily or permanently,
partially or totally. While it was known with a reasonable degree
of accuracy how many there were who has been discharged from the
several services on Surgeons’ Certificate of Disability and the
number discharged with disability noted at the time of discharge,
it was not possible to foretell the magnitude of that considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>body of men and women who though discharged from the service
apparently in good health would subsequently develop a disability
traceable to military service. Even at the present time, more than
three years after the Armistice it is not possible to state the exact
magnitude of the medical problem confronting the United Veterans’
Bureau, since new claims for compensation because of disability are
being filed at the rate of approximately 541 per day. As an index
however to the magnitude of this problem, gentlemen, let me tell you
that to date have been filed more than 762,000 claims for compensation
for disability and death incurred in military or naval service. While
this total number of claims have not all been allowed, this number
does constitute the present potential load for the United States
Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the original War Risk Act and subsequent acts amendatory
thereto,—the United States Government recognized its very great
obligation to the ex-service men and women who had become disabled
through service, and by these Acts provided not only financial aid
to the disabled veterans but also all reasonable medical and surgical
treatment and care, whether in a hospital, out-patient office, or at
home.</p>

<p class='c010'>The problem of hospitalization itself soon became of paramount
importance. It was initially recognized that, in spite of the
meagre governmental hospital facilities then available for the care
of beneficiaries of the United States Veterans’ Bureau, it was essential
for the best administrative control of veteran patients and for
the best professional control over their treatment to place the
beneficiaries of the United States Veterans’ Bureau under government
supervision in government owned or operated institutions. The carrying
out of this policy has been proceeding steadily at a rate commensurate
with the rate at which additional government hospital beds have
been made available. At no time however has it been possible to discontinue
the use to a considerable degree of contract civil institutions.
Even at the present time the United States Veterans’ Bureau is utilizing
approximately 757 civil institutions for the care of approximately 8,924
of its beneficiaries, and has contracts with a total of 1,524 civil
institutions for such care. It is however significant to note while
in July 1920 more than fifty percent of Veterans’ Bureau patients were
in contract hospitals, on January 1, 1922, but 30 percent of patients
were in contract hospitals. Furthermore the number of hospitals being
utilized at any time had dropped from approximately 1200 to 757.</p>

<p class='c010'>The curtailment in the use of private facilities was of course
the direct result of increased facilities in government operated
hospitals. The United States Government had originally stipulated
that the hospitalization of veterans of the World War should be provided
for the United States Public Health Service through its
Marine hospitals and such other hospitals as it had been authorized to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>acquire. When however it was discovered that the immediate facilities
offered by these hospitals were insufficient to meet the demand for
hospitalization, the hospital services of the United states Army, the
United States Navy and the National Homes for Volunteer Disabled
Soldiers were to a certain extent made available to the United States
Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>In March, 1919, the United States Public Health Service was
operating but 21 small Marine Hospitals. In order to meet the demand
made upon it by the then Bureau of War Risk Insurance, additional
hospital facilities were rapidly acquired, so that by November, 1919
there were in operation a total of 38 hospitals with a total bed
capacity of approximately 7,625. A year later namely on November 1,
1920 there had been made available a total of 52 hospitals representing
13374 hospital beds. At the present time, January, 1922, there
are available 65 United States Public Health Service Hospitals representing
approximately 18,200 hospital beds. It is true that due to the
necessity of securing with the least possible delay adequate hospital
beds, it was necessary to make use of certain Army cantonment hospitals
of temporary structure. Hospitals of this type are admittedly unsatisfactory,
and it is my earnest desire to close such hospitals just as
soon as properly located hospitals of permanent construction are
available to take their place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although prior to July, 1920, there had been a limited use
made of the facilities of the Army, Navy and National Soldiers’ Homes
in the case of Veterans’ Bureau patients, it was not until that date
and in accordance with provisions of the Sundry Civil Act of the 66th
Congress that a systematic and more extensive use of these facilities
was proposed. It was perceived that with the general reduction in the
Army and Navy personnel a number of large and well equipped government
hospitals were not being utilized to their full capacity. The utilization
of these facilities would have a two fold result, first, the
placing of a larger number of patients under direct government medical
supervision, and second, a more pronounced curtailment in the use of
contract civil facilities.</p>

<p class='c010'>In June, 1920, under plans agreed upon by the representatives
of the then Bureau of War Risk Insurance and of the several government
services there were immediately made available 4181 hospital beds,
not including those in operation by the United States Public Health
Service divided among the services as follows: Navy Department Hospitals,
1760; War Department Hospitals, 1510; National Soldiers’ Homes,
911. Additional plans contemplated increased facilities by all those
services. At the present time, January 1922, in accordance with these
plans the following number of beds have been made available by these
three services: Navy Department, 3396; War Department, 2917; National
Soldiers’ Homes, 3317; Total, 9630.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>I have briefly outlined the growth to the present time in
government hospital facilities available to the United States Veterans’
Bureau. Combining the figures I have enumerated it is seen that the
total number of available government hospital beds has increased during
a period of a little more than two years and a half from a few thousand
beds in 21 Marine hospitals to a total of 28655 beds in 94 government
hospitals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me now outline briefly the growth in our hospital population
over this period. In September, 1919 there were recorded a total
of 6003 patients of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, which total had
increased by January 1920 to 10907, and by July 1920 to 19,489, averaging
over this period a monthly increase in hospital patients of
approximately 1225. From July 1920 to January 1922 the hospital
population increased from 19,489 to 29,263.</p>

<p class='c010'>These 29,263 patients are hospitalized to the following extent
in the several classes of facilities: United States Public Health
Service, 13,874; United States Army, 1530; United States Navy 1473;
National Soldiers’ Homes, 2637; St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Interior
Department, 825; Contract Civil Hospitals, 8924. By general class
of disease, these patients are divided as follows: Tuberculosis,
11,822; Neuro-psychiatric, 8,414; General medical and Surgical, 9027.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the total number of 28,655 government hospital beds available,
20,339 are occupied at the present time, leaving a balance of
8,316 unoccupied hospital beds.</p>

<p class='c010'>As previously stated, it is the policy of this Bureau wherever
practicable, to remove beneficiaries of the Bureau from contract
institutions and place them in hospitals operated by the governmental
medical services. If it were possible at the present time to fill
every vacant government bed by patients in contract hospitals we
would still be obliged to continue 608 cases in contract institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>An analysis of the vacant government beds shows that they fall
under the following category:</p>

<p class='c010'>A review of these two sets of figures shows that although
there are apparently ample facilities for the care of general medical
and surgical cases, there is a real and serious shortage of government
beds for the care of tuberculosis and neuro-psychiatric cases.</p>

<p class='c010'>In considering the use of government hospital beds at present
reported vacant, it is of course entirely impracticable to attempt to
accomplish the complete filling up of all government hospitals. As
you all realize, this is due to a number of reasons, chief of which
are (1) the administrative necessity at all hospitals of maintaining
a surplus of beds amounting to from ten to fifteen percent of capacity
to allow flexibility in case of epidemic or sudden emergency; and to
permit unhampered the routine admission and discharge of patients,
(2) the location of vacant beds away from the points of greatest demand,
and (3) the fact that the vacant beds available are not of the
type required at points where the Bureau needs them.</p>

<p class='c010'>From an analysis of this whole situation it is believed that
we have sufficient beds available for the care of general cases with
the exception of two or three areas of the country, such as Memphis,
Tennessee, and in the metropolitan district of New York. Some provision
must be made to care for cases of a general nature because
facilities at these points are totally inadequate. In New York, the
existing facilities must be given up by June 1922.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, the number of general medical and surgical cases
requiring treatment will steadily diminish and contract hospitals
in many instances would ultimately be able to care for their needs.
On the other hand, the Bureau must make provision for the care of
tuberculosis and neuro-psychiatric cases for many years to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>The general medical and surgical cases are a type which
justify the use of contract institutions more than the other classes
referred to, by reason of the comparatively short length of time
that treatment is indicated: emergency conditions which require
immediate hospitalization where the patient may be; and the disinclination
on the part of claimants to be far from home, especially when a
surgical procedure is indicated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hospital program of the Veterans’ Bureau is meant to provide
approximately 20,500 permanent beds for the treatment of tuberculosis
and mental cases. It is estimated that between the present
time and the end of 1923 the Veterans’ Bureau will lose the use of
approximately 5,400 beds because the hospitals will have to be
abandoned by reason of expiration of lease, temporary nature of the
structure, or for other cogent reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hospitals being constructed out of the Langley Bill (Act
of 4 March 1921) and appropriations for the Public Health Service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>made either by the Secretary of the Treasury or the United States
Veterans’ Bureau which will become available during the two years
ending with the calendar year of 1923, will only provide 7,198 beds,
while during the same period of the time the Bureau will lose 5,397
beds for the reasons already indicated. The ultimate loss of beds
by reason of expiration of lease, temporary nature of the structure,
etc., will be approximately 4,875 greater than the beds which will
be provided as result of construction now going on under existing
appropriations.</p>

<p class='c010'>From careful studies that have been made, it is evident the
Bureau will require additional hospital facilities at the following
points:</p>

<p class='c010'>It has recently become apparent that the neuro-psychiatric
hospital at Marion, Indiana, operated by the National Home for
Volunteer Disabled Soldiers, can only care for nervous and mild
mental cases, and is not prepared to handle definitely insane.
Development in the future may make it necessary, therefore, to ask
for further provision for insane at that or some other point in the
country east of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p class='c010'>Estimating that we will have approximately 2,000 or 2,500 cases
in contract institutions for many years, the Bureau is endeavoring
to provide for a maximum load of about 32,000 cases, the peak probably
being reached in 1922. It is estimated that the general medical
and surgical cases will diminish rapidly, but that permanent beds
for the treatment of approximately 13,000 tuberculosis, and 9,500
neuro-psychiatric cases must be available.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gentlemen, I have attempted briefly to outline the growth
and the magnitude of our hospitalization program, and have told you
roughly what the expectation and needs of the United States Veterans’
Bureau in regard to hospitalization facilities are. It is all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>summed up in our earnest endeavor of the United States Government to
provide every ex-soldier, sailor, marine or nurse who becomes a
beneficiary is the United States Veterans’ Bureau with the best medical
treatment available under the best conditions possible. But in spite
of our needs for additional governmental hospital facilities, I want
to assure you all that to my best knowledge there is not a single
veteran of the World War, eligible for treatment and who has applied
for hospital treatment, for whom hospital facilities have not been
found or who has not been offered hospitalization.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Allow me to suggest just one thing. You will notice that on the
program there is a time for general discussion of all these subjects,
and I wish you would make pencil notes of the things that appeal to
you as being of importance enough to be called up during the discussion.
We are here really to get out of this all we can, and we
want you to feel free to call for any further consideration of these
subjects when we get to that hour of discussion.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have pleasure in introducing Major Merritte W. Ireland, who
will address you upon the subject of ‘The Army’s Relation to the
hospitalization of the World War Veteran’.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL IRELAND:</p>

<p class='c010'>The treatment provided in our military hospitals for World War
soldiers may be summarized in instructions approved by the Secretary
of War, which were about as follows: That no member of the military
service disabled in line of duty even though not expected to return
to duty, would be discharged from the service until he had attained
complete recovery or as complete recovery as could be expected he
would attain when the nature of his disability was considered. It
was laid down, further, that physical reconstruction consisted in the
completest form of medical and surgical treatment carried to the point
where maximum functional restoration, mental and physical, had been
secured. To secure this result the use of work, mental and manual,
was required during the convalescent period. This therapeutic measure,
in addition to aiding greatly in shortening the convalescent
period, retains or arouses mental activities, prevents the state of
mind acquired by chronic hospital patients, and enables the patient
to be returned to service or to civil life with the fullest realization
that he can work in his handicapped state and with habits of
industry much encouraged, if not newly formed. Early in 1918, the
Secretary of War also authorized the Medical Department to proceed
with the scheme for reconstruction of officers and enlisted men of
the Army alone without consideration of the other bureaus of the
government involved. This reconstruction it was clearly understood
would end at the point where the medical reconstruction ceased and
the future reconstruction of such cases was to be completed by other
agencies of the Government after the individuals had been discharged
from the Army.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Patients then were cared for in military hospitals up to
the point of maximum functional restoration, both mental and physical.
In the case of patients who were ultimately to be discharged from
military service, arrangements were made whereby the Federal Board
for Vocational Training might have access to these men as soon as it
was known that they were to be discharged and the educational officers
of the Medical Department were directed to cooperate with the representatives
of the Federal Board to the fullest possible extent, in
order that the patients concerned might have all the advantages
assured them by the Federal Government.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was recognized that in order to make this program
successful for the attainment of the maximum physical and mental
condition through complete medical and surgical treatment, it would
require the establishment of a policy of extended publicity. This
embraced the necessity to educate the public to the need of this
physical reconstruction for the disabled men before their return to
civil life; to educate the family of the soldier with regard to the
need of continued treatment that they might be satisfied to have them
remain in hospital, and finally, to educate the soldier himself by
placing in his hands at the earliest possible moment after his disability
had been incurred the necessary literature which would inform
him of his status as a soldier and of the privileges, which were to be
his as a disabled man, from the Medical Department of the Army, the
Federal Board for Vocational Education, the Bureau of War Risk Insurance,
and also to place in his hands such literature as would inform
him of facts concerning various trades from which he might choose a
vocation, together with all the information in regard to the need for
men in the various industries of the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>As above outlined this policy of treatment was carried out.
At the approved time for the discharge of the patients from the military
service, they at once became beneficiaries of the Bureau of War
Risk Insurance and subject to further physical reconstruction or education,
if such were necessary, under the direction of the Federal
Board, Public Health Service or the Bureau of War Risk Insurance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such facilities as were in our hospitals and were not required
for the care of the sick of the active list of our army were
placed at the disposal of the discharged veterans of the World War.
This was done mainly in two ways: first, by turning over to the Public
Health Service which was charged with the medical work of the Federal
Board, many complete hospitals and second, by caring for many of the
veterans in our own hospitals after their proper discharge from the
service.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><span class='under'>HOSPITALS RELEASED FOR CARE OF VETERANS</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>By virtue of Act of Congress in March, 1919, every military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>hospital, including its supplies, no longer required for the proper
care of the sick in the military service was to be turned over to the
Public Health Service if the latter service so desired. A detailed
classified list of hospitals approximating 2,460 beds turned over
under this law follows:</p>

<h3 class='c019'><span class='under'>VETERANS’ BUREAU CASES TREATED IN MILITARY HOSPITALS</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>“Now, with reference to assistance rendered within our own hospitals,
in an interview with the Director of the War Risk Insurance in 1919, I
heard the former Secretary of War say that he considered it an obligation
on the Army to assist in caring for the discharged World War
veterans and that any vacant bed in Army hospitals was always available
for the treatment of these men. To carry out this policy, the Bureau
of War Risk and later the Veterans’ Bureau was from time to time
advised by the Medical Department of the number of available beds in
our hospitals in which we could accept for treatment veterans of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>World War. The number of beds thus offered has varied slightly from
time to time, but has always been on the increase, particularly since
last July. Last May 1450 beds were available to the Veterans’ Bureau;
in October 1752 beds were available, and by November 24th 2200 beds
were available. The following brief table gives the exact status on
January 5, 1922:</p>

<p class='c010'>Within a few days we expect to open up several hundred beds at
Fitzsimmons General Hospital for veterans suffering from tuberculosis.
This last large increase has been made possible by funds transferred
by the Veterans’ Bureau to the War Department for the specific purpose
of enlarging this hospital. When the construction and alteration made
possible by these funds has been completed (and the completion is
expected almost daily) 700 additional beds for the tuberculosis will
have been provided in permanent structures for a little over $1000 per
bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to the buildings turned over to the Public Health,
which have already been enumerated, the Medical Department has turned
over to that Service supplies approximating a value of $12,336,000.00.
It has been a source of gratification to the Medical Department, and
I am sure to the War Department, that the Army was in a position to
assist in rendering aid to the American soldier disabled in the World
War.</p>

<p class='c010'>The total number of all cases treated in our general hospitals
during the last year was approximately 30,000; of these 10,000 were local
cases and 20,000 were general cases, and of the latter 15,700 were our
own and 4300 pertained to the Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>A brief summary of the Veterans’ Bureau cases treated in our
hospitals may be of interest. Of the 4,300 cases treated during the
year (October 1, 1920, to October 1, 1921) 180, or about 4% were
suffering from either nervous or mental conditions; 2195 or about 51%
with tuberculosis; 770, or about 18% with diseases or injuries of the
osseous system; 75, or nearly 2% with heart or vascular diseases, and
the remaining 25% was made up of all other conditions combined.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to this work, much assistance has been rendered in
making physical examinations for that Bureau to determine the right
to compensation or the necessity for hospitalization. Over 2,000 of
these examinations were made during the year, many of which necessitated
admission to hospital for varying periods to permit a thorough
survey in order that correct diagnosis or physical condition might be
established.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: “I am sure it must be gratifying to you to obtain
a more intimate knowledge of the conduct of these affairs.
I have pleasure in introducing to you Rear Admiral Edward R. Stitt,
Surgeon General of the United States Navy, who will inform you as
to ‘The Navy’s Part in the Hospitalization of the World War Veterans’.”</p>

<p class='c018'>ADMIRAL STITT:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Medical Department of the Navy has been able to work with
the Veterans’ Bureau along the following lines:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='under'>First</span>: the turning over to the Public Health Service for the care
of the Veterans of the World War of the Naval hospitals at Philadelphia,
Pa., Cape May, N.J., Gulfport, Miss., and New Orleans, La.
and quite recently to the Veterans’ Bureau itself of the hospital at
Fort Lyon, Colo. used for tuberculosis patients. These institutions
were completely equipped when transferred, so that no additional
expense was involved. The hospital for tuberculous patients
at Fort Lyon has been operated by naval personnel since November
first, but this institution will be taken over by the Public Health
Service on March 1st. With the great reduction in naval personnel
and the discharge from the service of large numbers of the tuberculous,
the needs of the Navy did not seem to justify the maintenance
by the Navy of so large a hospital, there being at present 735 beds
with possibilities of expansion. Upon his return from a recent inspection
the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service expressed
to me his admiration for the institution. We should not have
been able to turn over this hospital had it not been for the
generous offer of the Surgeon General of the Army to take care
of the naval tuberculous at the Fitzsimmons General Hospital at
Denver. The bed capacity of these five hospitals totaled 2229.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='under'>Second</span>: The caring for the veteran patients in the same hospitals
in which the sick of the Navy are being treated. In assigning
accommodations to the patients of the Veterans’ Bureau there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>many problem which complicate this matter. Manifestly it is
necessary for the Navy to be prepared to receive the patients from
its own personnel, and when it is considered that the fleet may
at one time be in the port of New York and sending its sick
to the New York Hospital during such time and then sail away
for another port to then transfer its sick to another hospital
the difficulties are apparent. If we could divide the ships between
different ports and their sick between different hospitals the
matter would be easy of adjustment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again we have only a limited number of beds in our three hospitals
on the Pacific Coast and at the present time a large fleet is based
on this station so that we are unable to offer accommodations in
those hospitals to the Veterans’ Bureau and at the same time make
adequate provision for the naval sick.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a general rule we are only able to provide hospital facilities
for general medical and surgical cases, but much of our work is in
studying cases of suspected tuberculosis and where a positive diagnosis
is made the determination of the extent of the process.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Great Lakes, Ill. owing to the urgent needs of this section of
the country, we have agreed to care for approximately 300 neuropsychiatric
patients, this in addition to 300 beds for general patients.
In order to obtain medical personnel trained in the supervision of
such cases it was necessary to withdraw our psychiatric specialists
from various stations where their services were needed, but it was
felt that this was a greater need. To provide for additional men
trained in this specialty we now have a number of young medical
officers under training at St. Elizabeths Hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Navy is not only indebted to Doctor White for this service
but it owes him obligations for his many years of instruction to
the classes at our Naval Medical School. At the present time there
are under consideration plans for the establishment under Doctor
White of a school for the training of psychiatric personnel for
other services caring for veterans, taking advantage of the abundant
clinical material at St. Elizabeths.</p>

<p class='c010'>At our hospital at Chelsea, Mass., we have been able to offer
539 beds to the Veterans’ Bureau and from the letters I receive,
as well as from a personal inspection, I can attest the care that
is there being given our veterans.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Navy is particularly proud of its good food and I think our
hospitals lead the Navy in this important service, which not only
makes for contentment but aids convalescence. We have just agreed
to receive the patients from the Polyclinic Hospital of New York
and expect in a short time to be caring for approximately 350
patients in the naval hospital located in Brooklyn. We are very
proud of the physio-therapy installation at this hospital, which
has been pronounced by experts as one of the most complete equipments
in the country.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>In our hospital in Washington we are offering 250 beds. In this
institution we are peculiarly well equipped for the diagnosis and
treatment of obscure cases by reason of its association with the
laboratories of the Naval Medical School. These naval hospitals are
geographically so situated that large numbers of patients can be
treated near their homes. Although most of our hospitals in our
island possessions are small yet we can take care of a limited
number of veterans who might be in such localities.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mental environment at these hospitals is admirable from a
standpoint of cheerfulness, amusement and when indicated occupational
recreation, our rule has been so far as possible to treat veterans
and sailors alike. To the Red Cross we owe much of the measures for
contentment among the patients, although we also owe obligations to the
morale division of the Navy Department for assistance along the lines
of recreational and educational opportunities, especially as regards
well conducted libraries. The number of beds now available in our
hospitals approximates 2900. Adding the 2229 beds transferred to the
Public Health Service makes approximately 5172.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='under'>THIRD</span> In the transfer to other agencies caring for veterans of
hospital supplies and equipment. As noted previously we have turned
over not only the beds of five hospitals but in addition surgical,
X-Ray, laboratory and other facilities as well as store rooms full
of varied supplies. In addition we have from time to time given
various medical and surgical supplies. I may state that we are
now turning over to the Public Health Service $1,375.00 worth
of stock from our Supply Depot and stand ready to transfer another
million dollars worth of medical stores when called for.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='under'>FOURTH</span> On board ship and at our various stations medical officers
have examined claimants by the thousands, assisted them in making
their applications and aided them with advice.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery one of our most important
activities is in supplying data to the Veterans’ Bureau for use in
the adjudication of claims for compensation. The reports at present
are more comprehensive than formerly made, and include in addition
to the name, rank or rate and claim number, the date and place of
birth, enlistment, discharge or release to inactive duty, together
with a detailed medical history. The maximum number of reports
sent out by the Bureau has been 250 in a day with an average daily
completion of about 100 cases. At present we are up to date in
answering claims. Notwithstanding the reduction of the clerical
force in some divisions to the point of extinction of the activity
in the effort to make the furnishing of records to the Veterans’
Bureau our first consideration we should have been far behind in
furnishing records had it not been for the hearty and willing cooperation
of the Veterans’ Bureau in assigning clerks from their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>forces to assist in this most important and imperative work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where by reason of law or otherwise we have been unable adequately
to provide for the veterans either in personnel or material Colonel
Forbes has ever stood by to give us hearty cooperation and assistance.
I am also indebted to General Sawyer, the Chief Coordinator of the
Hospitalization Board for encouragement and advice whenever asked of
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>In reciting the activities of the Navy in providing hospital
care for veterans, I trust it has become apparent that I have the
honor to represent an organization, equipped to aid the Veterans’
Bureau in fulfilling the pledges of our government to its veterans,
disabled in the Great War, and manned by a personnel actuated in
all ranks by an earnest desire to contribute in the discharge of
our obligations.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: “I do not know exactly what impression you get from
this information that is given out here by the heads of these great
departments, but to me it seems that here is a spirit, a whole-souled
determination to put everything at the command of the
Government at your service to help you, that we may help the World
War Veteran to the best that can be given. The recitation of these
things by this Admiral and this Major General shows how much really
comes through a closer affiliation,—how much we get that is worth
the while from a better understanding; and that is what we really
believe we have in this new Board of Hospitalization.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have with us this morning the man who has been personally
responsible for the largest number of these patients; in fact, he is
responsible for more of these patients than all of the rest of the
departments together; and if you do not know him, I should like to
introduce to you a man whom I have found, by close contact and
personal observation during the months I have been in Washington,
to be a man who is giving everything within him to make of the
Public Health Service of the United States of America the best
Public Health Service in the world and to give to the World War
veteran the best hospitalisation service that can be rendered.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have pleasure in introducing to you Surgeon General Hugh
S. Cumming, of the United States Public Health Service, who will
speak on the subject of “The Service Rendered World War Veterans
by the Public Health Service.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL CUMMING:</p>

<p class='c010'>In presenting even a brief outline of the services which have
been rendered, and are being rendered, to disabled veterans of the
World War by the Public Health Service, it is necessary, for a
proper comprehension of the subject, to state, at least in general
terms, the genesis of the relationships which the Public Health
Service has sustained, and now sustains, to this very important
responsibility.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Congress, before the close of the war, had given consideration
to a comprehensive plan for the care of disabled veterans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>totally unlike the previously existing pension systems, and had
passed legislation putting into effect this program.</p>

<p class='c010'>In doing so, use was made of existing agencies rather than the
creation of new ones. Among these existing agencies was the U. S.
Public Health Service. This Service, on March 3, 1919, was given
authority to furnish medical care and treatment to veterans, acting
in this capacity as an agency of the War Risk Insurance Bureau.
The Director of that Bureau was charged with the real responsibility,
but was permitted, under the legislation, to make use of the Public
Health Service in discharging his responsibility with regard to
medical care and treatment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Peace having come unexpectedly and demobilisation following
shortly thereafter, the problem of the care for the disabled veteran
became at once very pressing. The Public Health Service had
under its control only a few hospitals, with a total bed capacity
of about 1,500. The Director of the War Risk Insurance Bureau
looked to the Public Health Service to supply him with the necessary
medical services, and the Public Health Service, therefore,
found itself faced with the task of supplying, in a short space
of time, an extensive system of medical relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>It undertook this problem and, under the legislation, sought
to meet the responsibility in several ways. By the transfer to
its jurisdiction of facilities used by the Army and Navy during
the war, by the purchase of such facilities as were available and
within the moderate appropriation, by the leasing of fairly suitable
places and their conversion to hospital purposes, and by making
contracts with civilian hospitals all over the United States
for the care of veterans, this Service was able to furnish facilities
with rapidity. These facilities were by no means always desirable,
but at least it may be said that the Public Health Service was
enabled to keep pace with the demand and to supply to all veterans
who applied some form of hospital care and treatment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The administrative organization, which had been formed under
the law, for the care of veterans, included three bureaus, namely;
the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, the Federal Board for Vocational
Education, and the Public Health Service. This organisation, while
it was the best that could be formed under the circumstances, left
a good deal to be desired, and was the cause of much criticism and
no little dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Matters became so urgent finally that, under the President’s
direction, certain changes were made, and later, by act of Congress,
even more radical changes were made, all with the ultimate tendency
of concentrating in one organisation the entire responsibility for
all matters affecting veterans of the World War. This culminated
in the passage of legislation creating the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and charging that Bureau with the full responsibility for all
matters affecting veterans. (Aug. 19, 1921.)</p>

<p class='c010'>In the legislation creating this Bureau, however, the
Director of the Newly created Bureau was authorized, in giving
hospital care and treatment to his beneficiaries, to make use of
certain official agencies, and among these the Public Health Service,
which at that time was carrying most of the medical work for
veterans, and in fact this Service is still supplying by far the
largest number of hospital beds for their care.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under this new legislation, adjustments were made as rapidly
as possible, and are still going on, with the result that the
present situation of the Public Health Service in this responsibility
is fairly clearly defined for the first time since it has
undertaken this work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The U. S. Veterans’ Bureau has now taken over, or will shortly
take over, from the Public Health Service all of the responsibility
and all of the work involved, with the exception of the operation
of hospitals. The work taken over by the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau
includes the entire responsibility for the operation of all outpatient
departments for the care of veterans. Thus the Public
Health Service is now left simply as a hospitalizing agency for
the use of the Director of the Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Public Health Service, therefore, stands in the same
relationship to this work as other official agencies, namely; the
National Homes for Volunteer Soldiers, the Army, the Navy, and St.
Elizabeth’s Hospital of the Interior Department. That is to say;
it operates independently a system of hospitals for the use of
the Director of the Veterans’ Bureau in the care of his beneficiaries.
It has no responsibility with regard to meeting the
demands for hospital facilities and it has no responsibility with
regard to the distribution of patients to those hospitals. Its
responsibility is limited simply to the operation of such hospitals
as the Director desires, and, to the admission of such patients
as he may desire to send to the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Public Health Service was suddenly charged with the
large and important responsibility for supplying medical care and
treatment to veterans of the World War, it proceeded at once to
organize, on a commensurate scale, to meet a problem the character
of which was unknown and the magnitude of which could only be
surmised.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first and greatest problem faced by the Public Health
Service was, of course, to determine as soon as possible the
character and the magnitude of this problem. In conjunction with
the War Risk Insurance Bureau, there was compiled and finally
published a public document (481 of the 66th Congress, December 5,
1919). In this document, this entire problem was analyzed, and
certain very definite conclusions were stated as to the need for
medical and surgical facilities for the proper care and treatment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of discharged disabled veterans.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is unnecessary at this time to attempt any analysis of
this document, but it is worthy of some comment. It indicated
that within two years from the date of its publication there
would be needed for patients of the War Risk Insurance Bureau
7,200 beds for general medical and surgical cases, 12,400 beds
for tuberculous cases, and 11,060 for neuropsychiatry cases,
making a total of 30,660 beds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Recommendations in this document were made for the expenditure
of a large sum of money for necessary construction, and a
draft of a bill was offered which would appropriate the money for
this purpose. The bill contemplated that this money should be
expended in annual installments, extending over a period ending
June 30, 1923. This document also indicated that the peak of the
load, at least for neuropsychiatric and tuberculous disorders,
would not be reached for some years.</p>

<p class='c010'>The conclusions reached in this document were the subjects
of a good deal of criticism. It was rather generally felt that
the facilities which had been provided during the war for the
medical care and treatment of soldiers and sailors could be made
use of very readily and very satisfactorily in the care of discharged
disabled soldiers and sailors at the termination of the
war.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not clearly appreciated that the war program for the
care of sick and disabled could, by no means, be converted into an
adequate and satisfactory system of hospitals for the care of
sick and disabled persons under peace conditions. At all events,
no money was appropriated for purposes of constructing hospital
facilities until March 4, 1921.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is highly significant at the present time to note that
the needs foreshadowed in this public document have, since the
date of its publication, been more or less verified by subsequent
experiences.</p>

<p class='c010'>Making due allowances for discrepancies, which might have
been expected, and for developments, which could not have been
readily foreseen, it may be truthfully said that this document
indicated quite clearly and more or less accurately the hospital
needs for the care of sick and disabled ex-service men and women,
if these patients were to receive the character of medical service
which, in the judgment of the best medical minds, was necessary
for their restoration to health and which could not be satisfactorily
given in other than suitably constructed institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaving aside these considerations, it was apparent that,
when the Public Health Service was charged with responsibility,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>it was immediately necessary to meet the urgent demands suddenly
created by the termination of the war.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Public Health Service, in the manner indicated above,
attempted, therefore, to formulate and put into execution a
temporary program for the purpose of meeting immediate needs,
leaving a permanent program to be developed in accordance with
the appropriations and legislation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without going into any more detail, it will suffice to state
in very general terms the work which the Public Health Service has
done in this connection and which it is still doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the inception of the work, it has created a hospital
system of considerable magnitude, and is now operating some 68
hospitals, with a total bed capacity of over 21,000, and expects,
within the more or less near future, to open additional hospitals
and increase present facilities by something less than 5,000
additional beds.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Service now has under its care about 13,500 veterans
of the World War in its hospitals. In addition to this, it is
also caring for 3,000 to 4,000 Federal beneficiaries, with whose
care and treatment it has long been charged, making a total of
nearly 17,000 hospital patients under its care at the present time.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the development of this hospital system, the Public Health
Service has divided its hospitals into three large groups, namely;
hospitals for general medical and surgical cases, for cases of
tuberculosis, and for cases of neuropsychiatry. It has been unable
to develop this system of hospitals with the uniformity
desirable under the circumstances, and has, therefore, found difficulty
in meeting the needs of those suffering from neuropsychiatric
and tuberculous disorders. This demand, however, has of late been far
more adequately met, especially with regard to tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to the development of its hospital system, the
Public Health Service, soon after assuming its responsibilities in
this work, created what was designated as the District Supervisors’
organization. The United States was divided into fourteen districts
and, in some large center of population in each of these districts,
there was established a district headquarters, with a sub-district
organization reaching out even to the individual counties.</p>

<p class='c010'>This organisation constituted a decentralizing agency, and,
as such, served a most useful and important function, not only in
the work of the Public Health Service, but also in the work of
the War Risk Insurance Bureau. This entire organization, which
had grown enormously, was transferred to the Bureau of War Risk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Insurance in April, 1921, with its complete personnel. It is
now operated by the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau as its decentralizing
agency and is still performing a necessary and important function
in the work of that Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was also necessary to create a greatly extended purveying
service for supplying the necessary equipment, etc., to the hospital
system which had been inaugurated. The Purveying Service has
grown enormously and, at the present time, is not only purveying
to the hospitals of this Service, but is also rendering assistance
to the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau in purveying for its offices and its
medical facilities.</p>

<p class='c010'>The creation of an Inspection Service also became a necessity,
in order that the hospitals of this Service might be kept under
constant surveillance, and that all complaints might be carefully
investigated. This Inspection Service has now been reduced somewhat,
but still is functioning satisfactorily and has also rendered
a great deal of assistance to the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau in
making certain inspections for that Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to these matters, the Public Health Service also
began the creation of a large system of out-patient dispensaries
for the care of veterans of the World War and developed this work
considerably. Up to recently, it had in operation some 58 of
these dispensaries, many of them equipped and staffed for all
forms of out-patient diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The development of this dispensary system was a matter of
supreme importance in furnishing the medical examinations of
veterans required for the purpose of establishing their compensation
ratings. This entire Service, as stated, is about to be
turned over to the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau and will, in future, be
operated by them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In carrying out all of this work, the Public Health Service
has, of necessity, been obliged to assemble a large personnel.
The personnel at the present time is somewhat less than it has
been previously, by reason of the transfer of certain activities
to the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau, but, with the anticipated opening
of many new hospitals and the increase of its facilities, this
personnel must, of necessity, slowly increase.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the present time, the Public Health Service has in this
work about 1,700 medical officers, not including attending
specialists. Of these, about 950 are officers of the Reserve
Corps. A Dental Corps has been created and numbers, at the
present time, about 180 dental officers. A corps of female nurses
has been assembled and numbers, at the present time, about 1,800.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>A Reconstruction Service has been formed and numbers, at the
present time, about 580 reconstruction aides. A Dietetic Service
has been organized and numbers about 165 trained dietitians.
These figures will give some idea of the large personnel necessary
in the performance of this work.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is difficult to draw distinctions between the various
classes of personnel, but it may perhaps be said in general
terms, at the present time, that the most difficult qualified
personnel to secure is the medical officer. The Public Health
Service was peculiarly fortunate in assembling a large Reserve
Corps. At the close of the war, many medical men who had been in
the military forces were demobilized. Finding themselves somewhat
adrift, and having broken completely old associations, they were
inclined, if opportunity offered, to continue in the Government
service. A special appeal was made to these men by the Public
Health Service and inducements were offered to them to accept
service in the care of disabled discharged veterans. As a result,
the Public Health Service was able to assemble a much larger
number of reserve officers than could have been done under any
other circumstances.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been a matter of great difficulty to maintain among
these officers the necessary morale, by reason of the difficult
circumstances and conditions under which they are employed.
Having only a limited and somewhat uncertain tenure of office,
with many uncertainties as to their future, it is worthy of note
that they, nevertheless, have, given to the Government a service
which could not easily have been secured from any other source.
They have shown a fine spirit in the performance of this duty,
and, as much as any set of men assembled under such conditions
and circumstances, have delivered a service the quality of which
is comparatively high. The retention of their services seems to
me a matter of importance.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the inception of this work up to date (Jan. 16, 1922),
there have been cared for in hospital by this Service about
245,000 veterans, who have been furnished a total of about
12,831,000 hospital relief days. Also, about 1,945,000 outpatient
treatments have been given and a total of over 1,427,000
medical examinations have been made. Many special services of
various kinds have been rendered. For example; about 175,000
patients have been given dental treatment. Several thousand
patients are being given occupational therapy and several
thousand patients given physiotherapy every week. Prosthetic
appliances of various kinds have been furnished to thousands of
patients.</p>

<p class='c010'>The important matter of medical social service in its hospitals
has not been neglected by the Public Health Service. In
cooperation with the American Red Cross, there has been organized
an efficient medical social service, which has administered to
the needs of the discharged disabled soldiers and sailors. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>activities of the American Red Cross have been supplanted by many
other agencies, including the American Legion, Knights of Columbus,
Jewish Welfare Society, and others. All of these agencies have
rendered valuable assistance in the prosecution of this important
phase of the work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Public Health Service accepted a share in the responsibility
for the care of discharged and disabled ex-service men,
with a full comprehension of the privilege which had been conferred.
It has taken a pride in attempting to give to disabled
ex-service men the very best service possible. While its ideals
have not always been realized, it has, nevertheless, I believe,
always treated the ex-service man with consideration and given
him good professional service. It is my endeavor that the character
of this service shall continue to improve, and I believe that
it does improve constantly. No effort will be spared to render
the very best service possible under the circumstances and conditions
imposed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just what the future will hold for the Public Health Service
in this work, it is now impossible to say. It appears, however,
that the Public Health Service for sometime to come will be one
of the designated agencies for furnishing hospital care and
treatment to beneficiaries of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau. This
responsibility of supplying hospital facilities, with all that is
implied, will be as adequately met as possible. The Public
Health Service at the present time is operating a number of
hospitals which, from many standpoints, are not suitable to the
purpose to which they have been put. To attempt to operate hospitals
in unsuitable buildings, unsuitably located, subjects the
Public Health Service to unmerited criticism, but, since these
facilities are needed for a time, it will be necessary to continue
such places in operation. It is not possible, under such circumstances,
to render the highest type of service, but every effort
will be made to render the best service possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the construction which is now going on, under appropriations
which have been made available by Congress, it is anticipated
that, in the more or less near future, it may be possible for the
Public Health Service to close some of its unsuitable plants and
open others of a far more satisfactory character. This will relieve
the present situation a great deal and will do much to
obviate the criticism which has been made against the National
Government because it has not supplied suitable hospital facilities
for the care of men who have given so much to their country.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conclusion, it seems appropriate to say that the Public
Health Service, in all of this work, has realized fully the
necessity for the most complete and cordial cooperation with
other governmental agencies engaged in it. It has been a firm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>policy of the Public Health Service to stimulate an attitude of
cooperation on the part of all of its employees. It is a matter
of peculiar satisfaction at this time to say that the Public
Health Service feels that, in the present Director of the
Veterans’ Bureau, it is receiving from him a most cordial support
in this policy of cooperation and the relationships which
exist between these two Bureaus daily grow better, as they must
if the work is to be properly accomplished.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is also to be noted in this connection that the recent
creation of the Federal Board of Hospitalization has added to
the administrative machinery a piece of co-operating mechanism,
which will, undoubtedly, do much to stabilize and coordinate, as
well as standardize, many necessary things, which, up to this
time, have been carried on more or less independently. A governing
body of this character, which can lay down broad policies,
influencing all of the official agencies engaged in this work,
must of necessity be in a position to subserve a very useful
purpose. The sympathetic consideration and support of this body
should have a fine moral effect.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: “Representing General Wood we have Colonel Mattison.”</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL MATTISON read the following article prepared by General Wood:
relative to the N.H.D.V.S. and its Relation to the World War Veteran:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of all the various agencies utilized by the Federal Government
in caring for disabled men of the World War, the National Home
for D.V.S. is probably the oldest in this line of work, dating back
over fifty years in its care for disabled soldiers. Immediately after
the close of the Civil War, the necessity for some organization of the
government to care for the many thousand disabled soldiers of that war
became apparent, and in 1866, by act of Congress, the National Home
for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers came into existence with a Board of
Managers selected by Congress to carry out the purposes of this Act.
Prior to this, several of the States, civic and benevolent organizations
had taken up the work locally in many parts of the country, but the
creation of a National Board superseded the local work and for quite
a number of years prior to the time that State homes were established
by various States the burden of caring for disabled veterans of the
Civil War fell on the National Military Home.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first Home established was located at Dayton, Ohio
and was known as the Central Branch, but as the necessities of
the question developed, other branch Homes were established by
Congress until at present there are ten different institutions
under the control of the Board of Managers, scattered from Maine
to California. But as the Civil War was practically a war between
sections of the country, all the Homes, with the exception of the one
at Johnson City, Tennessee, are located either in the North or on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the extreme Northern border of the South. For example the Home
at Hampton, Virginia.</p>

<p class='c010'>Membership in the Home was originally confined to disabled
soldiers of the Civil War, but gradually as the need developed,
this privilege was extended to soldiers of the Mexican
War of 1846, the Indian campaigns, the Spanish American War, and
the Philippine service, so that by the year 1917 when the World
War occurred, practically all disabled soldiers who had served
in any of the wars of the Republic, were eligible to membership
in the Home. The high tide of membership in the Home was in 1906
when over twenty one thousand disabled soldiers were members of
the various Branches. After the peak of the load had been reached
there was quite a decided downward curve in membership owing to
the advancing years and heavy death rate among the soldiers of
the Civil War, so that by 1917 the membership had decreased to
about thirteen thousand men, and there were in the various branch
Homes many thousand vacant beds, both in barracks and in hospitals.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this connection, attention is called to the fact
that the Home functioned in a two fold capacity. It furnished
hospital service to the man who actually needed such attention
and it also furnished domiciliary service to men who were disabled
and prevented from taking care of themselves in the active
competition of life but who were not actually patients.
This latter service is called our domiciliary service and is a
service that probably will increase very materially in its scope
with the passage of time, as men who have served in the World
War, owing to disability will find themselves unable to meet
the active competition of the world outside and will therefore
need this domiciliary service in a very acute way.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the Act of October 6, 1917, eligibility in the
Soldiers’ Home was given to men who had served in the World War,
on exactly the same terms and conditions as it had been given
to the veterans of the other wars, and therefore today the disabled
soldiers of the World War stand in exactly the same position
in their rights to care and treatment in the National
Home as does the soldiers of the Civil, or Spanish American
Wars. But few men of the World War had taken advantage of this
privilege prior to the year 1920 when the Sundry Civil Bill for
the F. Y. 1921 gave authority to the Director of the Bureau of
War Risk Insurance, now the Director of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau,
to make allotments to the Board of Managers of the National
Military Home for alterations and improvements of existing facilities
to meet the demand of hospitalization from the Bureau of
War Risk Insurance. Such changes were thought necessary as a
large amount of space available was barrack space which while
satisfactory for domiciliary service, was not satisfactory for
hospital service.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Acting in accordance with the desires of Congress,
as shown in this bill, the Board of Managers at once entered
upon an energetic campaign of construction to prepare their
plants for this work. Conferences were held with the Director
of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, and the statement made
by him that the greatest need of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance
at that time was for tuberculosis and neuro-psychiatric
beds. To meet this need, and to grant to the fullest the wish
of segregation on the part of the World War men, two branch Homes
were set aside and their domiciliary and hospital population moved
to other branch Homes, and acting under the advice of the most
competent experts, the Board could find, the branch at Johnson
City, Tennessee was changed into a tuberculosis sanatorium, and
the branch at Marion, Indiana was changed into a neuro-psychiatric
sanatorium.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to the complete change of two branch
Homes, numerous and extensive improvements and alterations
were made at a majority of the other Homes so that the fullest
cooperation might be given to the Bureau of War Risk Insurance
in its great work, and today outside of the Home at Hampton,
Virginia, and the one at Danville, Illinois, which have been
practically set aside for the older class of veterans, adequate
facilities have been prepared for the hospitalisation of such
soldiers of the World War as may be assigned to them for hospitalization.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in this connection especial attention must be
called to one very peculiar and unique feature
of the service furnished by the National Military Home, and
that is the fact that under the law, the Home must care for the
victims of peace as well as the victims of war and furthermore,
that the gates of any branch Home are open to any disabled
soldier of the World War and that for admission, it is not necessary
that the disabled soldier be sent there by the U. S.
Veterans’ Bureau or any other organization. If he presents
himself with his honorable discharge and the medical examination
shows disability, under the law the Home must take care
of him as long as such disability exists, this whether the disability
be one of war or one of peace. To give a concrete example,
if a World War soldier presents himself at any branch
Home with a leg or arm amputated, under the law, the Home must
take care of him whether he lost the limb in the Argonne or in
a saw mill, and this feature is one that I think should be carefully
considered because it leads up to the question spoken of
above, of domiciliary care. Now a man with a leg gone is naturally
crippled in the battle of life and cannot compete on equal
terms in almost all professions or trades, but still when the
operation is completed and the wound healed, he does not require
hospital treatment but comes under the domiciliary class, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>cannot help but feel that there are probably many hundred of
cases along this line of disability which if transferred from
the active hospitals of other branches of the service to the
National Military Home for domiciliary care, will lighten the load
very materially of hospitals where active curative work is being
done, and increase the number of beds available for active hospital
work, and at the same time give the domiciliary case the best
of care and attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>This brief summary of the relation of the National
Military Home to disabled soldiers of the World War, leads
one to the inevitable conclusion that the work of the Home
in caring for these disabled soldiers is one that will increase
from year to year and if the results of the Civil War can be relied
upon, the peak in caring for these men will not be reached
for twenty years, possibly thirty would be a more correct estimate
of the time. In other words while it is probable that the
hospital peak will be reached by 1923 or 1924, and then fall off,
the domiciliary load is one that will grow from year to year and
become more and more important as time goes by.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conclusion, speaking for the National Military Home,
I wish to state that the relations existing between the former
head of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, Col. R. G. Cholmeley-Jones,
and the present Director of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau,
Col. C. R, Forbes, have in every way been most pleasant and cooperative
and every request made by the Home for allotments and
assistance in this work has been most generously and promptly met.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: “I have pleasure in introducing Dr.  A. White, Secretary
of the Board of Hospitalization, who will address you on the subject
of “the Neuro-Psychiatric Case and How to Meet its Requirements”.”</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WHITE:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The neuropsychiatry problem which the World War created and
presented to the medical personnel of the various branches of the Government
for solution, may be advantageously considered in three parts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first part of the problem consisted of dealing with the
conditions which developed in our armies during the war, more particularly
those conditions which developed as a result of the stresses of
actual service, particularly, of actual fighting. This large, and as
you well know, very heterogenous group, in some mysterious way came to
be labelled with the diagnosis of “shell shock”, a term which neuro-psychiatrically
was most unfortunate, and which continues its vexatious
existence.</p>

<p class='c010'>This group of cases, while a very heterogenous one, consisted
largely and perhaps most characteristically, of a multiplicity of types
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of conversion hysteria, cut aside from any attempt to diagnose in detail
the various forms that “shell shock” took, it is sufficient to say that
this group as a whole was a group of acute psychoses developed under the
severest of stresses of service conditions and that when these stresses
were relieved, and particularly after the signing of the Armistice, these
patients got well and to all intents and purposes this group as a whole
ceased to exist and so is not today one of our problems.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second group is the group of what I shall call the ordinary
State hospital type of psychosis. This includes the type of individual
that we ordinarily find in State hospitals, that has always been recognized,
that is usually called “insane”, and that for the most part was
discovered by the army rather than created by war conditions, although
it must be recognized that a certain number in this group might, under
the ordinary circumstances of life, have remained stable, at least much
longer than they did. However, there is nothing unusual or extraordinary
or unfamiliar in this group to the average physician of State hospital
experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to the treatment of this group, however, it should
be said that the great stimulus which came to psychiatry because of the
war came because the country discovered, and was astounded by the
discovery, that it had distributed throughout the length and breadth
of its population a vastly greater proportion of defective and mentally
ill individuals than it had the remotest dream of. Because of this
stimulus which psychiatry received, the matter of treatment has received
very much more intensive thought with the net result that there are today
more well recognized agencies for dealing with this class of patients
than ever before. Very briefly these agencies may be considered under
the following heads, some of which of course are not only well known and
well recognized, but have been used for many years, whereas others that
are perhaps equally well recognized have only received wide application
recently.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <span class='under'>first</span> of these agencies, perhaps, is the application of
the general principles of medicine and surgery to the treatment of the
sick individual. In other words, the patient’s general health becomes
a problem for inquiry and appropriate consideration, irrespective of his
mental state, on the general theory that physical health is at least the
best condition precedent for undertaking a restoration to mental equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <span class='under'>second</span> of these agencies is the complement of the first,
and is best designated under the general term of psycho-therapy and consists
in the recognition of the mental disease as such irrespective of
whether there can be found any physical foundation for it or not, and
on the basis of such recognition endeavors to deal with it as a thing
in itself. In passing I may say that theoretically the best results
would come if these two agencies could work hand in hand each with
sufficient understanding of the other.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>The <span class='under'>third</span> agency, which has been very much broadened in its
activities in recent years, I may designate as the social agency. It
recognizes implicitly at least, if not consciously, that mental disease
at any rate the kind of mental disease included in the second group,
the so-called “insane” is a disorder of the individual as a member of
the social group and that it manifests itself largely by disturbances
of his relation to his fellows, and therefore it becomes a legitimate
therapeutic endeavor to attempt a readjustment of these relationships.
To this end the social agency has been developed in many directions.
In the first place, we have amusements. The simpler amusements may be
called, speaking from the point of view of the patient, the passive
variety,—the type of amusement that is brought to the patient, such
as theatrical performances, moving pictures, and the like, whereas
the second type of amusement, which is more advanced and more valuable,
is the type in which the patient himself takes part, such for example
as theatrical performances in which he is a performer, musical programs,
in which he plays or sings. Then there is the group which is not after
all very widely separated from the amusement group and yet is somewhat
different, and that is the group which we might term athletic activities
and which demand upon the part of the patient some initiative.
These range all the way from the simplest activities, which are imitative
in nature, such as calisthenics under the instruction of the
athletic director, to mass games, where a large group of patients are
all engaged together in a common purpose, such as push ball, to games
of contest requiring not only initiative but a relatively high degree
of efficiency, such as the tug-of-war and the various types of races
and stunts, boxing and wrestling, and which are from time to time
advantageously staged on a field day and receive the added stimulus
of an audience. In addition to such activities as the above there are
also many minor ones of a similar nature, the principle of which,
however, is the same,—the social give-and-take of patient between
ward and ward, the instruction in such things as folk-dances, and the
like.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <span class='under'>fourth</span> agency, which has been very largely developed
recently, but which has always been used, is the agency of work. This
has been applied in approximately three ways. The first of these is
known as diversional occupation and comprises practically the whole
field of what is thought of by many as occupational therapy. The
activities in this field consist of such work as basket weaving, leather
tooling, bead stringing, rug weaving, and a thousand other similar
activities. The object of this activity is to assist in the re-direction
of the patient’s interests, to turn them away from infantile and
regressive objects, and to project them again into the outer world of
reality. Then there is the industrial type of work therapy in which
the patient is carried still further along the line of personal initiative
and given an opportunity to do creative work which is at the
same time useful and which helps him to keep in form pending the time
of his ultimate discharge from the hospital. And finally, there is
the vocational education work, which undertakes definitely and systematically
to give a man training in some specific direction which he can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>utilize, after he leaves the institution, and which will have a definite
economic value. For this latter work of vocational training there is
needed such psychological advice and assistance which will at least
prevent the wastage of time and effort upon unprofitable or impossible
tasks, whereas the vocational psychologist cannot by any rule-of-thumb-tests
tell that a man will make a success in this or that direction,
he can tell within reasonable limits that a certain patient cannot
profitably undertake a certain type of training, that his capacities do
not measure up to the minimum requirements that would make success
possible. In this way the work of vocational education for the neuropsychiatric
case can be narrowed down so that it can be applied more
intensively and more effectively to selected groups that can be reasonably
assumed to be good risks.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <span class='under'>fifth</span> agency, which can be advantageously brought to bear
upon the neuropsychiatric case, is the agency for extra-mural social adjustment,
and the personnel consists of the psychiatric social worker.
With her help the patient discharged from the hospital can have the
maximum amount of assistance for relating him again with the problem of
self-support and self-sufficiency. She, through her study of his
family situation, his economic status, his industrial placement and
social contacts can assist to these ends.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third group of neuropsychiatry cases is like the second,—a
group that has always been with us, but unlike the second it is a
group that never before has been systematically hospitalized. It is the
group of what might broadly be termed borderland states, comprising all
sorts of types of defective, delinquent, psychopathic, neurotic, and
mildly psychotic individuals. Whereas they perhaps present no new
problems when one is speaking from the platform of neuropsychiatry, they
do present a distinctly new group of problems from the standpoint of
hospitalization. Here all the agencies which have been described in
connection with the second group need to be brought into action, but
beyond them there needs to be a definite intensive study of methods for
the new hospital problems involved. I mention only one aspect of the
problem because it is one which has forced itself repeatedly upon the
attention of hospital authorities and that is the need for an intelligent,
and I may say, a therapeutic utilization of discipline in dealing
with these cases, in this group there very probably are contained a
reasonable number of individuals of unusual equipment, who, if our
ingenuity and our breadth of vision are great enough, may perhaps be
saved for some work of more than ordinary usefulness.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the medical agencies which it is contemplated to bring
to bear upon this third group of neuropsychiatry cases is the dispensary
because it is recognized that there is actual danger in hospitalizing
a certain proportion of this group, and therefore it is much better
to deal with them as ambulant cases. They can be dealt with in the
dispensaries which are equipped not only to take care of them, but for
all other medical and surgical conditions, and so will get the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>best possible attention. There should, however, be connected with these
dispensaries, especially the larger ones in the more densely populated
districts, a psychiatrist with psychotherapeutic training who should
have a psychiatric social worker to help him. If there are enough
patients to warrant it perhaps additional assistance might be needed.</p>

<p class='c010'>And finally, I would emphasize that in this great scheme,
which contemplates the hospitalization of from ten to fifteen thousand
neuropsychiatric cases of the general type above referred to there
should be included all of the armamentarium for scientific research
and all of the opportunity for individual endeavor and initiative which
is calculated to bring the brighter professional minds to bear upon
the subject and to illuminate it with the light of their genius. In
order that such results may be effected as promptly as may be, and with
the highest possible efficiency, I believe there should be established
a training center for neuro-psychiatrists where our younger men, who
are recently graduated from our medical colleges, and who have the
inclination to specialize in this branch of medicine, can fit themselves
in a minimum period of time to take it up as their life work. And that
this result may be accomplished I think it important that in extending
an invitation to the younger medical men to enter this branch of the
service that it should be possible to give them some assurance of
permanency in their respective jobs.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: “The subject with which Dr. White has dealt is so
important that it will have more consideration later in the program,
as you will notice.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is quite necessary in the operation of all affairs
with which Americans or even any of the human family deal, to have
somebody who knows something of the legislative procedure that is
necessary to the conduct of their affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Honorable Charles H. Burke was added to the Hospitalization
Board for two reasons: first, because he does represent
in his great family many hospitals, the services of many doctors,
likewise of many nurses. He therefore comes to us, being a Congressman
of long experience, as a man who can deal with the subject partly
from a professional aspect or view of the matter, and again with a
thorough and complete understanding of the legal side of the affairs
with which we are dealing.</p>

<p class='c010'>So I have great and special pleasure this morning in
presenting to you the Honorable Charles H. Burke, Commissioner of
Indian Affairs, who will address you briefly on the statutory regulations
affecting the hospitalization of the World War Veteran.”</p>

<p class='c018'>BURKE: “Mr. Chairman, fellow members, ladies and gentlemen:</p>

<p class='c010'>I think in the introduction of General Sawyer I learned for
the first time how it happened that I was accorded the honor and the
privilege of being a member of an organisation made up of such a distinguished
membership as is this Board, barring your humble servant.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>It would hardly be expected, after listening to these discussions
by these eminent experts in their particular lines, that I
would undertake to say anything along the scientific side of this proposition,
and I am going to be rather general in what I state in the
short time I shall talk to you.</p>

<p class='c010'>Government activities can only exist by reason of the law,
and so it will be proper to consider perhaps or discuss briefly the
application of the law with reference to the activities that are being
conducted, of which you, each of you, are a part.</p>

<p class='c010'>The responsibility for whatever the Government may do in this
or any other matter rests largely upon the Congress. I have hastily
gone through the legislation that has been enacted in the last few
years with reference to taking care of and providing for the ex-service
men, and during the war for their dependents, and for those who might become
incapacitated or disabled from any cause. There has been much
legislation, demonstrating that the Congress is keenly alive to the
importance of the situation. There has been one act after another,
and hardly an act but what has been amended within a very short time
after its enactment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The recent law is what is known as the Sweet Bill, the law
under which we are now operating. Within the memory of many who are
here present the appropriations for all purposes of the Government were
under a billion dollars, and there is being and is appropriated at the
present time nearly half of that amount for the purpose of caring for
the hospitalization, etc. of these ex-service men. Am I correct,
Colonel Forbes, in the amount of money that is being appropriated? It
is a vast and large sum of money, and it is the duty of those charged
with the responsibility of expending that money to see that we get a
hundred cents’ value for every dollar that has been appropriated. This
requires economy and efficiency, and this gathering and this organization
which General Sawyer is the chairman, was created for the purpose
of getting better results from the moneys that are appropriated by the
Congress; and you, each and every one of you, have been brought here,
as I understand, for the purpose of coming in closer contact with those
who are charged with the responsibility, in the first instance, of
administering the expenditure of this large sum of money; and you owe
to this responsibility exactly the same responsibility as does Colonel
Forbes or anyone else occupying a higher station than you may occupy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Therefore, I am confident and I am certain that when this conference
shall have concluded, every person that has come here will go
back to his respective place where his duty requires him, with a better
understanding and with a more determined disposition to try and render
better service and get really more for the money that is being expended
for the purpose for which it is being expended.</p>

<p class='c010'>Speaking of legislation, we shall undoubtedly require considerably
more legislation because, as I have stated, in the short time
since this subject was first taken up by Congress think of the progress
that has been made.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>As I understand, in 1919 the Public Health Service were hospitalizing
something like two thousand persons. General Sawyer stated
here today that we are now caring for twenty-two thousand; and I think
it has been stated—and it is generally considered—that the maximum
will soon be thirty-two thousand. So you see that it is more than
likely that we are going to have to have additional legislation and
more appropriation; and I may say to you generally that I have that
confidence in the American people—I have that confidence in the Congress
of the United States—to know that there need be no uncertainty
nor hesitation on any one’s part with reference to what may be done
to provide for caring properly for these dependents and these ex-service
men who are entitled to every consideration.</p>

<p class='c010'>I believe, as the result possibly of this conference, it may
be brought to the attention of this Board that there is some legislation
amending the so-called Sweet Bill. I think Colonel Forbes, as the
head of the Veterans’ Bureau, has already discovered and suggested some
very necessary amendments to the law, and I have no doubt that he will
be able to secure those additions to the law. It looks now as if we
may have to provide for additional hospitals by the enactment of further
appropriations of money. It will not be done unless it is necessary,
but I am sure if it is necessary that adequate provision will be
made and made promptly by the Congress.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the policies of this administration is coordination
and cooperation, and endeavor to avoid duplication in administrative
matters; and if there is a bureau charged with a certain responsibility
and with certain duties to perform, if it may be possible for
them to do what may be under the jurisdiction of another bureau, to
centralize and have this work done by one rather than two; and so
in the work of coordination in the administration of this particular
activity there has been a great saving. The Public Health Service,
I believe, makes certain provision and takes care of certain persons
at the request of the war Veterans’ Bureau and vice versa. I think it
has been said,—if it is true it ought to be corrected,—that when the
Veterans’ Bureau takes care of patients for the Public Health Service,
there has been no provision made for reimbursing the Veterans’ Bureau.
That will undoubtedly be taken care of by Congress, either by increasing
the appropriation for the Veterans’ Bureau, or providing that when
they render service for the Public Health Service, the Public Health will
reimburse them for such moneys as they may expend.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now one of the things that I want to particularly bring to
your attention, and to perhaps admonish you, in the two or three minutes
I have left, is to remember, as I stated at the outset, that
governmental activities exist only by authority of the law, and that
we must keep within the law; and remember, if there are some things
in connection with your duties that are not operating just as you would
have them, that they cannot be changed without changing existing law.
The responsibility for the law is upon the Congress of the United States.
The responsibility for this great undertaking is upon the Congress of
the United States, and if you have not sufficient money to properly take
care of these men, the responsibility is not yours; the responsibility
is upon the Congress.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>It is your duty;—it is our duty to bring to the attention
of the Congress the money that is necessary in order to properly handle
this subject. Then it is for the Congress to say whether or not that
amount will be appropriated. Under this present administration, those
of us who are in Bureau positions have been admonished that we must
keep our expenditures within the appropriations, and we have had brought
to our attention the statutes upon this subject. I am going to read them
to you for your information, and I want to say to you who may have
charge of an institution and have had a certain allotment of funds for
a given period, that it is up to you to see that your expenditures do
not exceed that allotment. If you have not sufficient money to do what
you feel you ought to do, you must reduce your expenditures for the time
being, regardless of its effect upon the service, because under the law
you have no right to create a deficiency or incur any liability on the
part of the Government in advance of an authorization and an appropriation
therefor.</p>

<p class='c010'>I want to call your attention to the statutes on this subject
because they are being brought to our attention not only by the President
and the head of the Bureau of the Budget, but by the Congress;
and so I want you people to understand that we are expected to follow
the law.</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>Mr. Burke read extracts from:</dt>
    <dd>Section 3679
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>Act of March 3, 1905.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>Section 5503.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c010'>That, ladies and gentlemen, is the law; and so I want to impress
upon you that you so conduct your institutions that you will keep
within the limit of the allotment that has been made for your institution;
and if you have not sufficient money, then bring it to the
attention of the head of the Veterans’ Bureau or someone else connected
with the administration. They will consider it, and if it shall seem
that more money is necessary they will not only recommend it, but I
think I can say for the Congress that the Congress will generously respond.</p>

<p class='c010'>I congratulate this conference upon its start. I hope that
there may be a general discussion,—that those who have come from long
distances will tell their experiences and make suggestions with reference
to anything that will improve this service; and I am very certain that
when the conference shall conclude on its last day it will adjourn with
a feeling that the time has been well spent, and that in the future we
are going to profit, and profit materially, as to the result of what
may be done in this conference and by it.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>GENERAL SAWYER: “Fellow workers, I certainly hope that this introduction
this morning has given you two things; first, that it has
given you the impression that the men engaged at the head of the
affairs of this Government in this subject are capable, worthy men.
I hope it will have given you the same inspiration that I carry
away this morning,—to go on with this conference and with your
work after you leave here more earnestly if possible, more sincerely
if you may, and certainly with more determination to bring
about the results we all have in mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>This morning you have heard the various members of the Board of
Hospitalization make their addresses, brief of course as they have
been and in many instances not entirely fair to them, considering
the subjects they have to handle; but they have done as well as
time will admit.</p>

<p class='c010'>This afternoon this conference, under the chairmanship of Colonel
Forbes will take up a special subject or two, and will then
go into the matter of the general discussion of the affairs as
they have been presented today. We want you to feel that we are
here to listen as you have listened this morning; and so we are
going to ask each one of you to participate in the discussions.
We want this to be an active meeting, of men in motion, so that
when this conference does close we may have the satisfaction that
has been expressed here by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Sawyer asked that, upon adjournment, the members of the Conference
assemble outside the building in order that a group photograph
might be made.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>At 2:00 P.M. the meeting was called to order by Colonel
C. R. Forbes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The roll was called by Dr. W. A. White.</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL FORBES:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first paper of the afternoon was to have been read by Colonel
Patterson, Medical Director of the Veterans’ Bureau; but in his absence,
Dr. Rawls, of the Public Health Service, will deal with the subject of
‘Operation of Dispensary and Dental Clinics’.”</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. RAWLS:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I regret very much that Colonel Patterson cannot be here today,
because he had some very definite statements to make about the dispensary
problem of the Veterans’ Bureau. It was only last night that his
physical condition warranted his telephoning to the Bureau his impossibility
to come. In his absence I shall attempt to give you briefly a
plan of the dispensary service of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Veterans’ Bureau plans to establish a chain of dispensaries
throughout the United States, located in the fourteen District Offices
and in the hundred and twenty six sub-offices.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a new idea but is the logical result of past experience in
furnishing service to the patients of the Veterans’ Bureau and in providing
adequate medical facilities. It may not be amiss to trace the
development of this idea from the time when the Veterans’ Bureau was in
its infancy as the Bureau of War Risk Insurance and when the problem of
securing examination reports on claimants for compensation and providing
treatment to patients amounted to a grave emergency.</p>

<p class='c010'>No ready made medical service existed to which the Bureau could turn
for its needs. The problems of demobilisation confronted the Army and
Navy. The Public Health Service was presented with the needs of the
Bureau of War Risk Insurance and undertook the difficult task of forming
a medical organization throughout the Country to meet these needs. The
United States was then divided into fourteen districts with the District
Headquarters and a medical officer of the Public Health Service in charge,
called a “District Supervisor”, who was directly responsible for the organization
of a medical staff throughout his District. The first plan
for medical service was the appointment of physicians as designated medical
examiners on a fee basis wherever there were claimants of this Bureau
to be examined and treated, the ultimate object being to have at least
one designated examiner in every county of the United States. By January
of 1920 this object had been attained and designated medical examiners
had been appointed in every city and town and in almost every village of
the county.</p>

<p class='c010'>The District Supervisors soon found this a most expensive method of
accomplishing the work. The Bureau concurrently found it increasingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>unsatisfactory in its result—an army of physicians widely scattered,
whose work was difficult to control and well nigh impossible to standardize.
The requirements of the Bureau were very definite. As a result, the
Public Health Service developed the <span class='under'>medical unit</span> plan of organization,
which, in brief, was the formation of groups of physicians in the larger
communities to make complete general and special examinations and to give
careful study to cases requiring treatment. The results were so far
superior to any previously obtained that the Bureau of War Risk Insurance
urged the District Supervisors to complete the organization of their
Districts along these lines and to use the designated medical examiners
as little as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next step in the development of the dispensary idea was the establishing
in the District Offices of large examining clinics staffed by
officers and appointees of the Public Health Service devoting their entire
time to this work and reinforced by the consultant services of the best
specialists which the cities afforded.</p>

<p class='c010'>The growth of the District Offices had passed all expectation and a
serious problem faced the Public Health Service in enlarging these offices
in accordance with this plan. However, there was no question of the wisdom
of establishing in the District Offices adequate facilities for making
examinations, as this feature was one of vital importance to the Bureau
because on the accuracy and completeness of the examination reports depended
the award of disability and the determination of compensation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Public Health Service faced this problem squarely and, loyally
supported by the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, demonstrated the wisdom of
this move. The Surgeon General went even further and established real outpatient
dispensary service in connection with certain examination clinics
in the District Offices and hospitals of his Service.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bureau of War Risk Insurance then assumed direct control of the entire
District organization and the Director, Colonel Forbes, after an
extended survey of this organization and the methods of furnishing service
to his patients, which took him into practically every District Office and
many of the larger cities served by medical units, evolved the plan of
extending dispensary service to every section of the Country. With his keen
insight into organization problems, one of his first moves was to obtain
Congressional authority to further divide the Districts into sub-districts.
He appreciated that each sub-district office was a potential dispensary,
the examination clinic in each District Office and the medical unit at each
sub-office being the nucleus upon which to build a U. S. Veterans’ Bureau
Dispensary Service.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the terms of the Veterans’ Bureau Act, the Director is charged with
the responsibility for proper examination, medical care, treatment, hospitalization,
dispensary and convalescent care, necessary and reasonable after
care, welfare of and nursing service to beneficiaries of the Veterans’
Bureau, and since he is so charged, the manner in which dispensary and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>reasonable necessary after care can be afforded is a matter of immediate
importance. It is therefore proposed to establish in each District Office
and sub-district office a dispensary of standard type which will vary only
in size according to the amount of work in the city and surrounding
territory which it serves. It is proposed to establish a type of dispensary
to be used as a standard which will provide facilities for a medical
clinic, a tuberculosis clinic, a neuro-psychiatric clinic, a surgical clinic
and an eye, ear, nose and throat clinic. In addition, there will be a
dental unit, primarily for the purpose of making accurate dental examinations,
and secondarily for the purpose of furnishing dental treatment. It
is proposed to establish an X-ray laboratory and a small clinical laboratory
and pharmacy. These are the facilities of the standard type of dispensary
proposed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the District Offices, and in a few of the largest Sub-offices, this
standard type will be developed to the greatest extent as these offices
bear the greatest burden of making examinations and furnishing out-patient
treatment. In addition to the clinics above mentioned these Offices will
be equipped with complete Physiotherapy Clinics.</p>

<p class='c010'>The initial expense involved in establishing dispensaries will necessarily
be large, but once established, will not only furnish medical service
of the highest type to patients of this Bureau, but will, it is believed,
result in an actual economy when compared with the present method of
providing similar medical service practically on a contract basis. X-ray
service alone costs the Government large sums annually which, with the
establishment of the dispensary, can be practically eliminated. Laboratory
service is also an expensive item of out-patient service when performed
by contract, which can also be eliminated. Dental treatment to which
patients of the Veterans’ Bureau are entitled under the law, is a matter of
grave concern as it is handled at the present time on account of the great
expenditure involved. This expense can be very materially reduced if the
Bureau establishes its own dental dispensaries where careful examinations
can be made and definite determination of the dental disability can be made
by trained examiners. Treatment to which the patient is entitled can then
be furnished either by the dispensary or performed by contract under close
supervision.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every medical officer in charge of a hospital is faced with the problem
of de-hospitalization of patients of this Bureau who have reached the
maximum amount of recovery afforded by hospital treatment. I believe there
is not a medical officer here who is not facing this problem at the present
time and who knows that patients are in hospital not actually requiring
further hospital treatment but who do need further medical attention and
careful medical observation to enable them to make a complete recovery.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is believed that the dispensary with its trained professional staff
to render medical treatment and to provide medical follow-up and after care
during that period when the patient is undergoing the final stage of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>physical recovery and is making his social and vocational recovery to a
life of usefulness in the community, will meet a long felt need. It is
believed that the period of hospitalization can be materially shortened
if the patient can be discharged directly to a well organized out-patient
dispensary where his treatment will be continued and his social and industrial
rehabilitation made under the careful surveillance of trained
medical groups. The effects of hospitalization, prolonged after the
maximum benefit has been received, are injurious to the average patient
and if continued, soon makes of these patients domiciliary charges upon
the Government. This is to be deplored and prevented.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as the dispensaries are established, this Bureau is, and will
continue to place them more fully at the disposal of the hospitals for the
purpose of shortening hospitalization and hastening his physical and
social recovery.  This is one of the most important functions of dispensary
service.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Director is charged, under the law, with not only providing treatment
for compensable claimants of this Bureau, but he is also charged with
maintaining the physical condition of claimants who are undergoing vocational
rehabilitation during the period of their training. The dispensaries
have been located as far as possible to serve the greatest number of
trainees and will provide medical service to take care of the so-called
intercurrent diseases and accidents from which the trainee may suffer
as well as furnish him treatment for diseases or disabilities connected
with his service. With the increasing number of claimants availing themselves
of vocational rehabilitation, the problem of medical service is one
of no small import and it is believed that the dispensary furnishes the
best solution of this problem.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another class of beneficiary of the Veterans’ Bureau who is
entitled, under the recent Veterans’ Bureau Act, to medical treatment—namely,
those claimants whose disability is not sufficient to warrant an
award of compensation. Heretofore only patients who were compensable were
entitled to medical treatment and the claimant must have a disability of
ten percent or more to entitle him to compensation. Under Section #13 of
the Veterans’ Bureau Act, a patient with any degree of disability is
entitled to treatment for a disease or disability, which is connected with
or aggravated by service. This adds a class of patients to whom the
Veterans’ Bureau must provide treatment now and in the future. The dispensaries,
it is believed, will meet this demand.</p>

<p class='c010'>The establishing of dispensary service by the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau is
therefore the logical outcome of past experience in the examination and
treatment of its patients. The Director is also enjoined by the Veterans’
Bureau Act to furnish adequate medical care including dispensary service,
follow-up and after care to claimants of this Bureau. The matter has been
given and is being given careful consideration in this Bureau and it is
hoped that in the near future the dispensary service of the U. S. Veterans’
Bureau will extend throughout the United States, for the convenience of all
disabled veterans of the World War and for the betterment of the treatment
which this Bureau is endeavoring to give.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>COL. FORBES: stated that it was believed that the dispensary was the
type that could do everything but put the man to bed; that it was
decided that it would require an appropriation of seven million dollars
to put over the dispensary program; that the Bureau has a dental bill
of 435 thousand dollars; that the dental work is one of the big items,
as is the x-ray service under the present contract system; that heretofore
the examiner was the workman; that the patient would go for examination,
and the examiner would say: “You have two teeth out on this
side, and it is no use to put one in on this side unless you have the
other two put in also; that the bureau has had bills come in for dental
service for one mouth in the amount of $350.00; that that service has
been abused; that x-ray bills for one mouth have ranged from $15 up; that
$3.50 was decided upon as a general figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall now have a half hour’s discussion of the topics presented in
today’s program so far.”</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. LAVINDER: suggested that explanation be made to the officers present
concerning out-patient relief, stating that shortly the Veterans’ Bureau
will assume entire responsibility in that connection.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: repeated the statement that the Veterans’ Bureau will assume
the entire responsibility.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. EVANS: Called attention to the part of General Sawyer’s address which
summarized the personnel for a 200–bed hospital, and stated that he
believed there was an error in the numbers as he had formerly compiled
them;—that 14 people would be sufficient to cover the three phases of
work (Occupational Therapy, Social Service, and Vocational and Prevocational
Training).</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: stated that the correction would be made.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON CHRONQUEST: asked if the personnel just mentioned applied to
all types of hospitals, general, T.B., and N.P.</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL FORBES: stated that they do.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON BAHRANBURG: stated that he thought there must be an error in the
figures as given; that at St. Louis they have a 650 bed hospital, with
an average of 600 patients; and that with the use of aides in greater
proportion than here mentioned, they cannot do as much work as is required
of them in that line.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: asked for his recommendations concerning additional aides.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON BAHRANBURG: suggested 12 as the number of physio-therapy aides;
and the same number for occupational aides. He added a few words
concerning the clinic at St. Louis, stating that they had 162 cases
last month; that they have an x-ray laboratory, etc., and that the
cost of operation of the dental clinic was a little over $8000 a month.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>SURGEON YOUNG: inquired as to the basis on which were derived the figures
for total per diem cost.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES:  that the Bureau has a complete analysis of the cost of operation,
and that this matter would be discussed later in the conference.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. SANFORD: stated that he was interested in the dental clinic in
Denver, and remarked that the dental clinic was the hardest to handle.
He added that their dental bill for one month was $3760, but that their
expenses in that connection were much less now; that they have a
personnel of eight full-time doctors—three men in the laboratory; and
that the clinic there is a complete one.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: “There is no question but what the fee basis is costly. Our
own clinics are the most economical.”</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON (Army &amp; Navy Gen. Hosp.): asked how long this expense for
dental treatment was to continue,—if it were to continue during a
man’s life.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: stated that the law provides that any man who has 8% disability
has a dental disability; that the x-ray is largely responsible
for this dental treatment; that the matter is one to be adjusted by
those present who are responsible for having the x-rays made and for
prescribing dental treatment.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON McKEON: made reference to Colonel Patterson’s paper and the necessity
for removing men from hospitals as soon as the need for hospital
treatment ceases to exist. He stated that men are retained in hospitals
longer than is necessary, due largely to the fact that they
want to take up vocational training. He recommended that the Rehabilitation
Division make a survey of a patient about three months prior
to discharge, so that when the patient is able to be discharged from
the hospital, he may enter training at once.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: Read Section 2 regarding vocational training; but added
that in the rearrangement of the Veterans’ Bureau now in process there
will be a closer liaison between the Rehabilitation Division and the
Medical Division, and the Rehabilitation Division will be represented
in the hospitals.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. EVANS: stated that a recommendation is to be presented to Col.
Forbes, for his approval or disapproval, to the effect that the
educational director in a hospital will be the Bureau’s representative
there in regard to rehabilitation work and will furnish data
regarding the man as to what he has done and what he can do.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: said he understood that this representative was accounted
for in the list presented formerly by Col. Evans.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. EVANS: answered that that was the provision made.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>COL. FORBES: said that he believed that the rehabilitation proposition
is much more of a medical problem than an educational one; that
there must be a closer medical observation of the men and not quite
so much education; that if the physical disability can be removed
first, then the man is better equipped for vocational work; that
the man should have the maximum of hospital treatment before he is
put into vocational work; that the problem is 90% medical and 10%
educational.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON DEDMAN (Greenville): stated that his place had adopted the system
of sending a copy of the physical report of the Board of Medical
Officers to the social welfare part of the Red Cross, and one copy
to the educational department of the Veterans’ Bureau so that the
Bureau might be in constant touch with the man’s physical condition.
He recommended that there be in the sub-offices experts on T.B., etc.,
and thereby eliminate the sending of men to hospitals when they have
no trace of such disease.</p>

<p class='c010'>He expressed appreciation of the work of the Red Cross in his community.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: added his appreciation of the splendid service rendered by
the Red Cross, and stated that that organization had recently made
available to the Bureau $175,000 for recreational purposes.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON STITES: stated that the educational director at the Alexandria
hospital is kept in constant touch with every patient there, particularly
those approaching discharge. He also stated that he was particularly
impressed with what was contained in General Wood’s paper with reference
to the care and treatment of disabled veterans whose disability is in
no way connected with the service; that there are veterans in his community
who need treatment, but whose disability is not connected with
service.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: emphasized the fact that the law provides that the disability
must be in line of duty or during the period of military service.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: in answering a conferee, stated that the law providing for
admission to Soldiers’ Homes was amended to apply to veterans of the
World War; and that all that is required of the man is to make application
to any National Soldiers’ Home and present an honorable discharge
from the service.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON MILLER: expressed his interest in Dr. White’s address; that it
called to mind a condition which exists at some of the T.B. hospitals.
He said that a case of Dementia Praecox is often found with active T.B.,
and that where such a patient is accustomed to taking convulsions,
it is very disturbing to the other patients at the hospital.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: said that the N.P. cases could be sent to Marion, Indiana.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON MILLER: said he had a telegram saying that admittance was refused
to active T.B.-Dementia Praecox cases.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: recommended that he take this up with his Surgeon General.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>SURGEON WILBOR: spoke concerning the patients at Gulfport, and stated
that many of these men lack confidence in themselves as regards training
and have to be encouraged. He recommended that the men be given
a partial course of training in the hospital, after discharge, in order
to give them sufficient confidence.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: said that he believed that if a man were able to pursue six
or seven hours of educational activity, he should not be hospitalized;
that heavy machinery, etc. should not be in hospitals.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES called upon Captain Blackwood, U.S.N.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPTAIN BLACKWOOD: stated that he did not have anything special to say,
as he had intended reserving his remarks until later. He said that
he was discouraged at hearing so many exaggerated adjectives used by
the conferees; that it should be realized that the patients came from
all walks of life; that the physical examination upon entering the
service was superficial in many cases, and the men are only now being
examined as thoroughly as they should have been before; that they are
now receiving better treatment than they would in civil hospitals,
as the Government is trying to eliminate the possibility of the patient’s
having a disease of which he is not aware, and thereby save future
trouble and expense for the Government.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: “Would you say that in all cases of medical doubt, a man
should be x-ray’d?”</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPTAIN BLACKWOOD: “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPTAIN BLACKWOOD: stated, in addition, that he considered the matter
of dispensaries a very good one.</p>

<p class='c010'>He also recommended that the amount of paper work for medical office
be reduced, as it seemed that the work they are trying to do in
medical way will be subservient to the clerical work. He stated that
he had reference to both Navy and Veterans’ Bureau papers.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: asked for his recommendation in this connection.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPTAIN BLACKWOOD: replied that he could not make any sweeping statement.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: called upon Colonel Kennedy, U.S.A.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. HANNER: represented Colonel Kennedy.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: inquired as to the number of patients at Letterman Hospital.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. HANNER: answered that they have 84. He inquired concerning a few
patients sent to them by the proper authorities, where the disability
has no connection with the service.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: inquired as to what had been done in such cases.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>COL. HANNER: replied that the men had been taken in and that some of
them had been hospitalized and some not—pending authority from the
District Manager to discharge them from the hospital.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: stated that if there is a question of doubt, the man is
to be given the benefit of the doubt and his hospitalization continued;
that if it believed that the disability is not due to service, the
officer is to be guided strictly by Regulation 27, and he should inform
the District Manager; that the Sweet Bill provides very liberally
for the care and treatment of ex-service men, and that he would see
that everyone present received a copy of the Sweet Bill, a copy of
the Vocational acts, and the original War Risk Act and its amendments;
that he wanted all to read them very carefully. He added that it is
the medical advice and decisions that the Bureau has to depend upon
regarding the care and treatment of the men.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. SNELL, (N.H.D.V.S.) asked if a man should be hospitalized if he presented
himself to Dwight, Illinois, for example, but his disability
was not of service origin.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: said that the man is to be hospitalized, and his case determined
later; that is he has a contagious disease the city will
take care of him.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: called upon Surgeon Quick (P.H.S.)</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON QUICK: stated that he was connected with a Marine Hospital,
which did not take T.B. or N.P. cases; that the patients were beneficiaries
of the Veterans’ Bureau and were mostly of the surgical
type; and that he felt there was very little he could add to what
had already been brought to the attention of the gentlemen present.
He stated that he believed the large percentage of medical men would
agree that rehabilitation was more of a medical matter than an educational
one.</p>

<p class='c010'>He also expressed himself as being in favor of the dispensary plan for
the Districts; but added that he felt there must be a great deal of cooperation
between the District Managers and the Medical Officers in
hospitals; also, that medical officers in dispensaries should use a
great deal of judgment in referring cases to the attending specialists.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: said that that was a medical question; that the District
Medical Officers should go the limit in providing hospital care if
in their judgment it is the proper thing to do.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON: stating that he had charge of the Army and Navy General
Hospital at Hot Springs, spoke concerning the discharging of
patients from government hospitals by reason of disorderly conduct.
He stated that when such men were discharged they were not granted
transportation to their homes, and therefore became nuisances to
the community there.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>COL. FORBES: stated that there is a General Order providing for the
payment of such transportation.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: inquired of this officer regarding the paper work of his
hospital.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON: answered that he found it very cumbersome; that he has
to make triplicates; that two of these copies go to the District Manager
who sends one to Washington.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: said he wished he would suggest to General Ireland a medium
for reducing this.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON: said that he was running two sets of records,—Bureau
and Army.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: replied that he was dealing with two distinct sets of men.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON: stated that he had just made out his annual report.
He said his place had treated 851 Veterans’ Bureau patients the last
year, and he told the different diseases involved.
Added that in many cases referred to them no trace of disease was
found; also, that one man was sent from Oklahoma and the only ailment
discovered was one decayed tooth.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: replied to the effect that that man is entitled to vocational
training under Section 2.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON GARDNER (St. Paul): expressed himself as being in favor of the
dispensary project, as it would assist the medical officers greatly.
He added that he has two patients suffering from paralysis, and
does not know where to place them.</p>

<p class='c018'>LIEUT. COMMANDER HIGGINS: stated that he is not in a hospital, but one
thing that impressed him in his contact with men in hospitals was
Dr. White’s “third class”, the border-line mental types. He said this
type gave the most trouble in hospitals, but that they do not get the
sympathy of many medical officers not accustomed to dealing with that
type.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: asked if he believed there were a lot of men hospitalized,
drawing compensation and taking vocational training from the Government,
who are not entitled to such.</p>

<p class='c018'>LIEUT. COMMANDER HIGGINS: replied that it would be a very hazardous thing
for him to say because he had not been in contact with them; but that
from a civil standpoint that might be true.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: asked Captain Blackwood if everyone in his hospital had a
disability.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>CAPT. BLACKWOOD: answered in the negative; and added that at his hospital
they got diagnosis varying anywhere from baldness to flat feet;
that the man claims the disability, and when the hospital cannot find
it, the man is discharged. He cited one instance where a man came
to the hospital claiming that he was suffering from “Compensation”.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: called upon Captain Dunbar, U.S.N.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPTAIN DUNBAR: said that he came prepared to offer statistics on the
League Island Hospital, and added that he thought that that hospital
had been doing as much work for the Veterans’ Bureau as any of the
naval hospitals; that out of so many sick days, one third of them
had been devoted to the patients of the Veterans’ Bureau.
Remarked that during the past year it had not been necessary to discharge
a patient for disciplinary action, but that so far this year
two had been discharged for peddling drugs.
He also brought up the subject of treating patients for disabilities
other than those mentioned in the diagnoses upon admission to the
hospital, and gave as example a case diagnosed as “chronic gastric
catarrh”, but found to be an “ulcer” case. He said that in emergency
cases they went ahead and operated.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: instructed him to go right ahead and operate completely.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON COBB: stated that he did not think that any of the gentlemen
present were aware of any General Order allowing the payment of
transportation after disciplinary discharge.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. LLOYD: gave information to the effect that that General Order was
just being printed.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: stated that he would see that the proper authorization
was given, and that the travel blanks were placed right in the
hospitals.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON COOK (Houston): asked if such transportation would take the
man to his home or to place of hospitalization.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: replied that transportation would be to the legal residence
or to place hospitalized.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: called upon Dr. Guthrie to inform the doctors present
concerning the difficulties in the Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. GUTHRIE: said he had been inclined to listen because he felt that
the reactions from the field had been more than the Bureau’s.
He informed the doctors that Col. Patterson had deemed it necessary
to place a Bureau representative in each hospital—the larger ones—in
order to take care of the very things that the doctors had been
bringing up in the conference.
He added that many such matters would be discussed later in the
conference in addresses.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>SURGEON KOLB (Waukesha): suggested that a hospital to take care of less
than 100 patients be established, preferably on an island, for the
care of drug addicts and pronounced psychopaths.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: suggested that Surgeon Kolb present that as a resolution
a little later when such were in order.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. DE WITT, (U.S.A.): expressed a need for a Bureau representative
at his hospital at Ft. Sam Houston, where there were 246 patients,
beneficiaries of the Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: assured him that a representative would be placed there.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON RIDLON (New Haven): remarked that the Sweet Bill made provision
concerning Pulmonary T.B., but that he felt that T.B. of the bone
should be considered in the same class.
He also suggested that the period of two years be extended to three,
stating that in many cases a boy is not examined for two years; he
comes to the medical officer shortly after the two years have expired;
the medical officer is pretty certain he has had T.B. within the two
years after discharge, but by reason of the two year limit, the claim
cannot be settled in favor of the boy.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: replied that that was a matter for the medical men to decide,
but that he could see no reason why the boy’s claim should not
be adjudicated.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: “Many times I have complaints coming through my office.
I wonder if you gentlemen would really like to know what my office
represents. I am the liaison officer between yesterday and tomorrow.
Any difficulties of any kind that ever come through my office are
those that do not get through anybody or everybody else. So a number
of these complaints about the extensive and exhaustive records and the
paper work that is being carried on in the various departments come
to me. I think the matter is of such importance that I should like,
Sir, to make this motion:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c026'><span class='under'><em class='gesperrt'>MOTION</em></span></td>
    <td class='c008'>‘That a committee of five, representing each of the departments, be selected to take under advisement the matter of the paper work of the various departments and to make such suggestions and recommendations as they may deem advisable; this, regarding hospitals’.”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>Motion was seconded by Surgeon General Cumming.</p>

<p class='c010'><em class='gesperrt'>Motion carried.</em></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>SURGEON KOLB: offered a resolution:</p>

<p class='c010'>‘That there be established a special hospital of
100 beds for treatment of beneficiaries of the
Veterans’ Bureau who are pronounced psychopaths
or drug addicts.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Then followed a general discussion by Dr. Klautz, Dr. Cobb, and others
regarding drug addicts who have T.B., regarding the manner of retaining
such patients in hospital contemplated.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. GUTHRIE: stated that the Bureau is investigating such a matter and
invited suggestions from the doctors.</p>

<p class='c010'>The above resolution was offered as a Motion, and was seconded by Dr.
Wilbor.</p>

<p class='c010'><em class='gesperrt'>Motion carried.</em></p>

<p class='c018'>DR. FOSTER: suggested the cutting of the man’s compensation as a means
or help toward keeping him in the hospital,</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: replied that when a man has become hospitalized, and his
disability has been connected with service, he is entitled to $80 a
month.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was here remarked by a conferee that General Order No. 27 would take
care of such patients; that if he left the hospital his compensation
would be cut and he would not be readmitted within so many months.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON CHRONQUEST: offered the resolution that action be taken by the
Hospitalization Committee toward the establishment of a Federal commitment
law in psychopathic cases.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: replied that there had been decisions made against such
a suggestion, by reason of the fact that it interfered with the prerogative
of the States.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON CHRONQUEST: mentioned the possibility of a suit being filed
against the commanding officer of a hospital for the illegal detention
of a patient.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WHITE: explained that a man in the service—Army, Navy, etc.—could
be sent by the Secretary of War, of the Navy, to St. Elizabeths
as well as anywhere else; but that the courts in the District state
that as soon as the man changed to civilian status his commitment ends,
and he is illegally detained.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. FORBES: suggested that the question be referred to the Legal
Division of the Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>COL. FORBES: “The conclusion of this session precludes me from any
further activity here. There is a little lack of enthusiasm here.
I want you to remember that we have asked you gentlemen here by
and under proper authority, and that it cost a good deal of money
to bring you here, which money is coming out of my appropriation.
Now you have got to come through with everything that is in your
systems; you have got to give us resolutions, advice, etc., and as
long as I am coming to these meetings I want to see lots of interest
and enthusiasm shown, especially by you gentlemen who are commanding
large institutions. Surely you have known lots of improvements you
could suggest. I want you to make such suggestions.</p>

<p class='c010'>During tomorrow’s session when we are having motions and resolutions,
have something to offer. We are here to serve the Government
and the ex-service men. I want you to help me, because in helping
me in my work you are doing what the law has provided for the ex-service
men.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have been in your hospitals, most of them and I am wonderfully
well satisfied with the work you are doing. I am wonderfully happy
because of the spirit shown and the accomplishment you have made.
You have worked against odds many times, and I know there has been
lack of appreciation. What moneys you need for medical service
it is my duty to see you are allotted. I want you to know that
we are not opposing any of the medical activities, because as I said,
I believe and I am satisfied that our greatest problem in this work
is one of a medical nature. Of course the Veterans’ Bureau must properly
operate through its doctors, and those of you who are handling
this big medical problem must help me, and I must do what you decide
is best to be done in the interests of the men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At 10:00 A.M. the meeting was called to order by General
Sawyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The roll was called by Dr. W. A. White.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: Called attention to the fact that is had been discovered
during yesterday’s afternoon session that a number of
resolutions would probably be presented during the Conference,
some of which would require very close attention, and that the
Federal Board of Hospitalization is of the opinion that it is
quite necessary to appoint a Committee on resolutions, whereupon
the following Committee was appointed.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>Committee on Resolutions.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Major General Merritte W. Ireland, U. S. A.,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rear Admiral Edward E. Stitt, U. S. N.,</div>
      <div class='line'>Surgeon General H. S. Cumming, U.S.P.H.S.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In accordance with a resolution passed during yesterday’s
session, the following Committee was also appointed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>Committee on Forms:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Captain Norman J. Blackwood, U.S.N.,</div>
      <div class='line'>Surgeon M. C. Guthrie, U. S. Veterans’ Bureau,</div>

      <div class='line'>Major L. L. Hopwood, U.S.A.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>General Sawyer urged that the Committee on Forms meet at
the earliest possible moment in order that plans may be devised
to take up immediately the work involved in this connection and
that suggestions be obtained from the Committee, which will necessarily
be brought to the attention of the heads of the Departments
represented in the Federal Board of Hospitalization. He stated
that every endeavor will be made to simplify matters in order that
clerical work may be reduced to the lowest point consistent with
the requirements of law. He pointed out in this connection that
the requirements of this nature had recently been modified by
over fifty per cent and that the Internal Revenue Service is now
taking up this same subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Sawyer introduced Major General Merritte W. Ireland,
who presided over the morning session.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>GENERAL IRELAND: requested those present to make extensive notes as
to the points brought out by the various speakers relative to
such matters it was desired to discuss later, stating that the
papers would first be read and would then be open for discussion.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. P. S. HALLORAN: read a paper on the subject of “U.S. Veterans’
Bureau Inspections, U. S. Veterans’ Hospitals”, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The inspections of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau hospitals were formerly
made by the General Inspection Service of the U. S. Public Health Service.</p>

<p class='c010'>In October 1921, the Director authorized in General Order #39, the
organization of an Inspection Service of the Medical Division of the Bureau
under the provisions of sections 2 and 9 of the Act of Congress
approved August 9th, 1921, commonly known as The Sweet Bill.</p>

<p class='c010'>In carrying out Section 6 of the Sweet Bill which authorized the decentralization
of the Veterans’ Bureau, the Inspection Section was organized
to consist of the Chief and several assistants located in the Central
Office, and an Inspection Section in each District Office.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Section in the Central Office functions under Assistant Director
of the Medical Division, and the Inspectors of the District Offices
function under the immediate supervision of the District Medical Officer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Chief of the Inspection Section directs and co-ordinates the
duties of all personnel assigned to Inspection Section including those
temporarily assigned to it for special duty, for example, various
specialists at the Central Office are available to investigate matters
pertaining to their specialty, and for this purpose, are temporarily
assigned to the Inspection Section and work under the direction of the
Chief of the Section to whom their report is submitted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ordinarily the District Inspectors make all inspections and investigations
within their respective districts when directed by the District
Manager or the Director of the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau. Only special cases
are investigated by the Central Office.</p>

<p class='c010'>In general, the duties of the Inspection Section are to make such inspections
and investigations as may be necessary in order to standardize
the character of examinations, medical care, treatment, hospitalization,
dispensary, and convalescent care, nursing, vocational training, and such
other services as may be necessary for the welfare of beneficiaries of the
U. S. Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Upon the organization of the Inspection Service in each District, instructions
were given from the Central Office, that the work of the
Inspection Service would first be to make complete inspections of all
Contract Hospitals caring for ex-service men. The inspection of Governmental
Hospitals to be delayed until the Contract Hospitals had all been
inspected. This course was taken due to the fact, that is was generally
known Governmental Institutions were well organized, and had recently
been inspected by Officers of their respective services.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inspections of Governmental Institutions made by the Inspection
Section of the Bureau are limited to matters which directly concern the
welfare of the beneficiaries of the Bureau. Investigations of the official
conduct of acts or officers of Governmental Services ordinarily are conducted
through the regular agencies of those services which are organized
to guide and control their own personnel, and to whom such matters are
referred through proper channels to the Director of the Bureau for transmission
to the services concerned, for their investigation and administrative
action.</p>

<p class='c010'>See General Order No. 28—U. S. Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the policy of the Director to cause an investigation to be made
of all complaints received which concern the welfare of the ex-service man,
although it is realized that often complaints are grossly exaggerated.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the comparatively short period which the Inspection Section
has been functioning, the following are a few of the principal complaints
received and investigated:</p>

  <dl class='dl_3'>
    <dt>(1)</dt>
    <dd>Loss of property such as valuables and clothing of patients. Investigation has shown,
    that patients were not informed of the hospital regulations regarding the disposition to
    be made of these articles upon admission; adequate lockers not available, or total
    disregard by patients of existing hospital regulations.
    </dd>
    <dt>(2)</dt>
    <dd>Preparation and shipment of remains of deceased;—casket too small, shabby lining; no flag
    furnished; shipping-box broken, due to lack of reinforcements; shroud of cheap material.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>Investigation usually shows gross exaggeration. In some instances specifications for the
    casket, shroud and shipping-box have been such that cheap material is provided. Due to
    this fact the contract price has been too low. The Director is willing to provide
    sufficient amount and desires that presentable casket and substantial shipping-box be
    furnished.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>Investigation has also shown that record is not always kept that the remains have been
    inspected by a medical officer, before shipment.
    </dd>
    <dt>(3)</dt>
    <dd>Poor food, especially weak coffee, and food cold when served. Investigation usually shows
    fares as a rule, are good, the complainant usually being tired of institutional menus.
<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span></div>
    </dd>
    <dt>(4)</dt>
    <dd>Cooks and other food handlers not examined for venereal diseases and carriers.
    </dd>
    <dt>(5)</dt>
    <dd>Mixing colored and white patients in wards and dining rooms.
    </dd>
    <dt>(6)</dt>
    <dd>Rough handling of patients by attendants. Reports are usually greatly exaggerated, or
    without foundation.
    </dd>
    <dt>(7)</dt>
    <dd>Arrogance and overbearing on the part of Medical Officers towards the beneficiaries. Such
    charges have not been substantiated.
    </dd>
    <dt>(8)</dt>
    <dd>Sputum of T. B. patients not examined routinely at stated intervals. Temperature of T. B.
    patients not taken.
    </dd>
    <dt>(9)</dt>
    <dd>Rest periods not enforced.
    </dd>
    <dt>(10)</dt>
    <dd>Insufficient bed clothing. Investigation has shown a few instances where blankets through
    long service are much worn and have lost their warming properties.
    </dd>
    <dt>(11)</dt>
    <dd>Insufficient heating. In a few instances, it has been shown that T. B. patients have no
    warm place to dress and undress in, when taking open air treatment.
    </dd>
    <dt>(12)</dt>
    <dd>Fire drills not held, and regulations not posted.
    </dd>
    <dt>(13)</dt>
    <dd>Delay in making physical examination after admission of the patient to hospital.
    </dd>
    <dt>(14)</dt>
    <dd>Beneficiaries claiming they were not informed of the provisions of General Order #27, U.
    S. Veterans’ Bureau, 1921, upon admission to a hospital.
    </dd>
    <dt>(15)</dt>
    <dd>Bed linen not changed sufficiently often.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c010'>In general, the above list of complaints are rarely received
from Governmental Institutions. When Inspectors have found unfavorable
conditions effecting the welfare of the beneficiaries of the Bureau in
Governmental Institutions, prompt remedial measures are usually instituted
to correct the conditions by the Commanding Officer of the Hospital.”</p>

<p>LEON FRASER<br />Acting Director,<br />U. S. Veterans’ Bureau.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>SENIOR SURGEON B. J. LLOYD, (U.S.P.H.S.,(R)): presented the second paper,
entitled “Admissions to, Transfers and Discharges from Hospitals
of Beneficiaries of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau,” which is given below:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not often speak in public. Occasionally I attempt to
speak extemporaneously, but today I shall claim your indulgence and
confine my remarks strictly to what is written in this manuscript,
for the reason that if taken in a disconnected sense some of the things
I shall say might sound sensational, whereas if taken in a connected
sense and in the way I shall say them, I think you will agree with me
that there is absolutely nothing sensational in my remarks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Attendance at this conference is indeed both a privilege
and an opportunity. To be asked to address this gathering is a
distinction worthy of the best that can be said on the topic assigned.</p>

<p class='c010'>I take it that you are already familiar with the rights and
benefits to which the disabled ex-service man is entitled; that you are
familiar with the usual routine of paper work and other procedures in
admitting, transferring and discharging, and I shall therefore omit
some of the more or less definitely settled, fixed policies in this
discussion.</p>

<p class='c010'>I fully realize that my subject is an extremely important one
and that it is in a measure connected with nearly every benefit extended
to the ex-service man or woman, and with every service that is rendered
in his or her behalf. On the intelligent administration of the
functions of admission, transfer and discharge to, or from our hospitals,
as the case may be, depends, in great measure, not only the economical
and efficient administration of our entire hospital program, but in
equal measure the recovery, the health, the happiness, the future usefulness,
even the very lives of men and women, many of whom have made
great sacrifices and passed through great agonies.</p>

<p class='c010'>When I make these assertions, do not think for a moment that
I am comparing these functions with the actual volume of work that is
done in the hospitals, with the relief that is given therein, nor with
the benefits which accrue to the patient, but, just as victory in a
great battle may depend on the placing of the right troops in the right
place at the right time, so victory, in the struggle of the disabled
ex-service man for rehabilitation, for health, or for life, may depend
on his being sent to the right hospital at the right time. Neither
must he be discharged too soon, nor kept too long, and when he is
transferred from one hospital to another there should be sound medical
reasons therefor, barring those unfortunate cases, where the beneficiary
may be transferred to a hospital near his home when it is seen that
death is inevitable.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Going back now to the contact which hospitalization makes,
or should make, with the other benefits extended to the ex-service man,
let me picture to you the state of our past, and to a great extent,
our present organization, by recalling to your minds the old story of
the six blind men of Hindustan who went to see the elephant, each trying
to tell what the elephant was like. The first man got hold of the
elephant’s ear and said that the animal was very like a fan; the second
got hold of his leg and said, “No, I can’t agree with you; this elephant
is like a young tree.” The third man got hold of the elephant’s trunk
and said, “The elephant is like a snake.” The fourth man grasped a
tusk and said that the elephant was like a spear; the fifth fell against
his side and said he was like a wall; and the sixth got hold of his tail
and said he was like a rope. Now all were partly right and each was
mostly wrong, and a somewhat similar condition exists with regard to our
work.</p>

<p class='c010'>This meeting, gentlemen, is an attempt to further co-ordinate
the efforts of all the agencies that are at work for the ex-service man.
Ours is a tremendous responsibility, both from the standpoint of our
duty to the ex-service man and of our duty to the taxpayer as well.</p>

<p class='c010'>No man except the man in the field knows better than I do that
you have been circularized and regulated and instructed and uninstructed,
informed and misinformed, ordered and dis-ordered, until I have no doubt
you have been tempted to slam your fist down on your desk and say, “Well,
for Heaven’s sake, how many bosses have I, anyway, and which lead had I
better follow.” And as for reports, no doubt you have wondered, “Well,
what <span class='under'>will</span> they want to know next?” And yet there has generally been a
fairly good reason for every question you have been asked and a reasonably
intelligent, honest, and often an enthusiastic, and sometimes an efficient
man or woman behind the interrogation point.</p>

<p class='c010'>In addition to having all these things done to you, I suspect that
you and your colleagues in the hospitals, some of you at least, feel
that you have been libelled and slandered by newspapers whose editors
thought they were telling the truth, and by newspapers whose editors
probably did not stop to consider whether they were telling the truth
or not. You probably feel that you have been libelled and slandered,
unintentionally of course, by men inside of legislative halls, and also,
again perhaps unintentionally, if carelessly, by men and women outside of
legislative halls, and by men and women both inside and outside of well-meaning
civic organizations. And, I may say that in the Arlington Building
in this city there are reams of evidence which might be cited in
support of your beliefs, and at “C” Building at 7th and B Streets, there
are tri-remes of such evidence, and these reams and tri-remes of evidence
have cost the Government of the United States thousands, tens of
thousands, yes, hundreds of thousands of dollars for investigations, when,
as a matter of fact, the majority of the complaints that have been filed
against hospital administration need never have been investigated by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Government at all if the individual who submitted the complaint had
taken the trouble to do a little honest investigating on his or her
own account.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fact that these statements have been made with the best intentions
in the world does not lessen the injustice contained in many
of the charges, nor does it remove the sting which has accompanied these
charges, and you, gentlemen, have listened to the soft pedal on the inside
and to jazz on the outside until you have probably said, “For the
love of justice, is there not some man who has grit enough to get up in
public and tell the truth and say what he thinks?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But, gentlemen, it will not always do to talk back. Actions speak
louder than words, even though they do not make as much noise, and
Solomon was right when a few centuries ago he remarked that “A soft
answer turneth away wrath.” We must <span class='under'>always</span> maintain a courteous,
gentlemanly, dignified attitude. We must never for a moment allow our
sympathies for the deserving unfortunate ex-service man to become in the
least weakened, and we must continue to give him the benefit of the doubt
in border-line cases, and finally we must maintain our equanimity under
the most trying circumstances.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now that we have you here, we are going to ask you some more
questions, and I hope you know the answers, because I don’t know the
answers to some of these questions myself, nor do I intend to answer
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In passing, I might remind you of the fact that in times past we
have spent money very freely on our hospital program, and that while
we still desire to give our beneficiaries what is perhaps a little more
than reasonable medical and surgical care and treatment, at the same
time we must be able to show Congress that we are operating economically
under present conditions, and certainly, when not in conflict with the
patients’ rights or interests, the question of economy of administration
must be considered in admitting, transferring and discharging. Are we
giving this question of economy of administration the proper consideration
in performing these functions, and if not, what are the reasons? We
want to know. This I will label “Question No. 1,” and let you think it
over for a while. It is perhaps not the most important question I shall
ask but it is important.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, having delivered myself of this question, and not having
answered it, I suppose you are ready for Question No. 2. Well, I am
not. I want to talk a little before I spring the next question. Of
course we all know that the primary object in placing a man in a
hospital is to give him a chance to get well, or as nearly well as
possible. This, however, is not the only thing to be accomplished in
the hospitalization of patients of the Veterans’ Bureau, and, if I may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>speak frankly, I may say that, while theoretically, hospitalization,
rehabilitation, and the awarding of compensation ought to dovetail into
each other without any overlapping or getting in each other’s way, as
a matter of fact they won’t do it,—at least they haven’t done it so
far; but, nevertheless, we’ve got to make the best possible connection
between these functions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us hark back to Regulation No. 57 of the old Bureau of War Risk
Insurance, which gave temporary total disability to the beneficiary whose
disability showed Service connection, together with compensation at this
high rate as soon as the man entered the hospital, and which cut down
this compensation anywhere from $80 per month to nothing at all as soon
as the beneficiary left the hospital. Although this Regulation has
been somewhat modified recently, it is still a very strong incentive for
men to seek hospitalization. It takes an unusually patriotic citizen to take<a id='t137'></a>
$30 to $60 a month or less when he can get $80 a month and board and
lodging if he can remain inside of a hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>Apropos of this provision, I recall the circumstances of a young
man who came to me quite some time ago, having left the hospital at Fort
McHenry. He presented himself in a courteous, dignified way, was perfectly
serious and absolutely frank. He began the interview by handing
me the card of a U. S. Senator. Then he told me his story, and it was
a good story. I shall try to recall it as nearly in his own language
as possible. “Doctor”, said he, “I have just left your hospital at Fort
McHenry. I do not like it. I realize that the Public Health Service is
not to blame for conditions which I found there. It is not suited for
a hospital. It is badly located. There are odors which it seems
impossible to overcome. The walls and floors are dingy, and while they
are clean, they cannot be made to look clean.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was shot through the stomach by a machine gun. Here are the
scars. If I do not work hard I feel fairly comfortable, and yet I am not
well, I receive $30 a month when I am outside the hospital, I receive
$80 a month and my board and room when I am in the hospital. Personally
I would much prefer to remain at home, but when I work hard enough to
make a living I break down. I have seen so many men in the hospital who
are receiving their board and lodging and their $80 a month who are not
as deserving of this as I am that I do not propose to remain at home and
work on my present compensation, and I would just like to see you keep
me out of a hospital. And furthermore, I demand to be sent to the
hospital of my choice. What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I replied, “Young man, you have been unusually frank in what you
have said. I shall be equally frank with you. If I had been wounded
as you have, and if I had the information which you have gained from your
stay in different hospitals, I should probably make the same demands.
You can have your transportation whenever you want it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>I saw this young man later at No. 38 in New York and he told me that
he was about to get what he considered a satisfactory rate of compensation,
and that as soon as he could get it he would go home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Question No. 2. How many men are there in our hospitals today who
would voluntarily leave if we did not, by providing total disability
rating and compensation while in the hospital, place a premium on their
remaining there? How many of those who would leave really ought to leave?
What can be done to correct the defects in the operation of Regulation
No. 57, modified as it has been? Perhaps you think I am giving you
several questions in one, but we will still label if “Question No. 2.”
I am not alone in desiring to know the answer to that question.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before I go any further let me say that I regard admissions,
transfers and discharges as such closely related operations that I shall
not attempt to treat them separately, but shall discuss them in any
sequence that may be convenient.</p>

<p class='c010'>I assume that all of you have been advised that under General
Order No. 59, the allocation, distribution and transfer of patients of
the Veterans’ Bureau are functions and prerogatives of that Bureau.
Theoretically, none of the Services has anything to say about these matters.
Practically, if I have not misunderstood the intent of this General
Order, it does not mean that, altogether. The actual authority
for and the right to refuse transfers certainly is vested in the Veterans’
Bureau and its representatives, but the Veterans’ Bureau and the District
Medical Officers and District Managers depend on you to tell them when
you think transfers ought to be made. Admission to a given hospital is
the prerogative of the Veterans’ Bureau within certain limits; that is,
the Service concerned must be able to take and care for the class of
patient sent by the Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to the discharge of patients from hospitals, the Veterans’
Bureau is continually encroaching, perhaps unavoidably, on what was once
the prerogative of the Medical Officer in Charge and the Service which
operated the hospital. Blanket authority for field transfers from one
district to another has been entirely withdrawn, and District Officers
must either place immediately in an authorized hospital in an adjacent
district, as specified in General Order No. 59, or, having placed for
observation or diagnosis a patient in a hospital within their own districts,
must apply to the central office if it is desired to transfer
later. It is, or should be, understood that under the present regime,
that Medical Officers in charge of hospitals who regard transfers as
necessary must request the District Office to make these transfers if
within the district, and must request the District Offices to obtain
authority from the Central Office if it is desired to transfer outside
of the District.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Several questions suggest themselves with regard to General
Order No. 59, and perhaps I should label this series of questions “No. 3.”</p>

<p class='c010'>(a) Has General Order No. 59 lessened the number of ill-advised
and unnecessary transfers, which is one of the objects, I
believe, that were intended to be accomplished.</p>

<p class='c010'>(b) Has General Order No, 59 caused any marked fluctuation
in the patient personnel of any of the hospitals? I notice, for
example, that Public Health Service Hospital No. 53, Dwight, Ill.,
has recently dropped from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occupied beds to 65 in number,
giving a surplus of 165 unoccupied beds. Houston, Texas, has
dropped from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occupied beds to 443 beds, giving a surplus of 528
unoccupied beds. At No. 32, Mount Alto, Washington, there is a ward
for colored patients which will accommodate 30, in which there are
only 6 colored patients at the present time. Are these fluctuations
coincidences or are they the effect of the Veterans’ Bureau having
assumed the functions under discussion. Of course if we could be sure
that these reductions in-patient personnel are going to be permanent
it would not make any difference. We could cut down our working
personnel at a hospital like Houston, Texas, and with the consent of the
Veterans’ Bureau we could close a hospital like Dwight, Ill., but will
the pendulum swing in the other direction again, and what advance information
can the Veterans’ Bureau give these fluctuations and of
their approximate duration?</p>

<p class='c010'>(c) Have you received very many patients who, owing to their
condition or to the nature of your facilities, or both, should
never have been sent to your hospital?</p>

<p class='c010'>(d) Has General Order No. 59 tended to delay the turnover
in those general hospitals having special wards for psychoneurotic
and psychotic patients, who are detained for a short time only until
they can be otherwise disposed of?</p>

<p class='c010'>(e) Should General Order No. 59 be modified, and if so,
in what particulars?</p>

<p class='c010'>Having delivered this third volley of questions, I shall talk a
little more. I have no idea what opportunities you gentlemen have had
to become familiar with the facilities at hospitals other than your own.
I have no idea what information District Managers and District Medical
Officers have of hospitals and conditions in Districts other than their
own. General Order No. 59 of course attempted to convey some idea of
the facilities in all of the hospitals used by the Veterans’ Bureau,
but it was impossible to incorporate anything like a comprehensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>statement with regard to these facilities. Quite recently, at the
request of Dr. Guthrie, and with the assistance of men in both Bureaus,
I prepared a questionnaire for all the hospitals, asking what
your general conditions and facilities were like. Most of the hospitals
have answered this questionnaire, and the information obtained
is exceedingly valuable. Practically without exception the answers
have been concise, complete and exactly what was asked. Those of
you who have not answered please do so as soon as you can. I wish
it were possible to print or mimeograph these reports and distribute
them. Certainly anyone who is charged with the responsibility of
placement and transfer of patients should have access to these reports.</p>

<p class='c010'>While I am on this subject of facilities, let me invite attention
to the fact that there are marked differences in the kinds of facilities
offered by different hospitals and by the hospitals of the different
Services. Let me also invite attention to the fact that we have
patients who, if properly distributed, would fit into these different
institutions possibly in a much more satisfactory way than at present
and at a smaller expense. Particularly I suspect that there are many
patients in Public Health Service hospitals that do not need the
highly specialized and necessarily expensive care that these hospitals
are giving, and I also suspect that there are many vacant beds in our
Soldiers’ Homes where these patients can be given all they need at a
much less expense than is possible in the highly developed hospitals
of the Public Health Service, and possibly those of the Army and Navy
as well. Why would not this be a good time to arrange for the prompt
transfer of such patients? Europe has found the Convalescent Home
to be an economical institution, being much less expensive than the
hospital. Why may not our Soldier’s Homes be used for convalescents and
those who need relatively little medical care and treatment, but who
are still not well enough to be thrown on their own resources? These
questions I shall not number. They just crept in.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one class of beneficiary that none of the Services seems
to be prepared to handle satisfactorily, possibly due to the fact that
legislation is needed to deal with this class. There may be a solution
other than legislation but none of us has thought of it as yet. I
refer to the drug addict who is entitled to hospitalization for some
Service connected disability. We haven’t any place to put such patients
and we do not know what to do with them after we put them there. We
do manage to take care of some of them but at great inconvenience,
and without being able to treat them for their own best interests. We
cannot get them admitted as irresponsibles by the Courts. We have no
such thing as involuntary<a id='t143'></a> commitment, and if one of them desires to walk
out of the hospital, out he walks if he is persistent enough about it,
and we cannot stop it. This is a good time to say something about what
we might to with these cases.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>I have said very little about discharges for the reason that
disciplinary discharges are to be treated by another speaker, and
Regulations Nos. 26 and 26–A, bearing on this subject are to be
discussed by Doctor Guthrie, who follows me on the program. I will
say, however, that this subject is an important one and I can easily
understand that from the standpoint of the man in charge of a hospital
present procedures with regard to discharges are unsatisfactory.
On the other hand, I can understand that when a man is in a hospital
it affords an excellent opportunity to settle once and for all his
claims for the various benefits provided by law, and yet I think
it is right that the Veterans’ Bureau should accomplish these objects
before the man is ready to be discharged. As yet this is not being
done.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conclusion, Gentlemen, I may say that as I see it, those
of you who are in charge of hospitals are, if you will pardon the
expression, between the devil and the deep blue sea. You are told
one minute that if you exceed your allotment you will go to jail,
and in the next breath you are told to go the limit if it is for
the ex-service man. You have been told that there is room for improvement
in your hospitals. No doubt there is, but in my humble
opinion there is also room for improvement in the laws providing
these benefits, in the orders, regulations and procedures designed
to administer these laws, and last but not least, there is a crying
need for some means of creating a sane public sentiment that will
enable the public servant to discriminate between the man who really
has a serious disability which he got in the Service who deserves
our help and our sympathy, and to whom you and I would give the
shirts off our backs if need be, and the man who spent a few days or
a few weeks in camp who is not really disabled but who proposes to
live at the expense of the tax payer just as long as he can get
away with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>We, Gentlemen, are not responsible for the law, nor is the
Director, and the Director has men who tell him what the law is and
he has to obey it and so do we, but it is our duty to point out
defects in the law and try to get them remedied.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>SURGEON M. C. GUTHRIE (U.S.P.H.S.) had for his subject, “Discussion—General
Order No. 26”, and spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The subject assigned to me for discussion is General Order No. 26.
This refers to U. S. Veterans’ Bureau General Order No. 26, dated September
6th, 1921, the subject of which is: “Admission to and Treatment in
Hospitals of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau Beneficiaries.” You are doubtless
all familiar with the general provisions of this order.</p>

<p class='c010'>It goes without saying that any definite order or instruction which
effects the policies and functions of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau and which
may be issued to the field is sure of a series of return re-actions from
various parts of the country, both as to the manner in which such an order
is applied and as to the consequences of its application. These reactions
are naturally good, bad, and indifferent; exact and truthful statements
or colored as to the manner in which they affect the various individuals
in its application, but coming from all parts of the United States
they afford many valuable and effective criticisms of the order in question
and are illuminating as to the original intent of the order and the amount
of deviation or variation from its original purpose brought about by the
manner in which it is put into effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>The criticisms of General Order No. 26 had to do very largely with
the “Four Days’ Notice” clause, and because of the fact that large numbers
of beneficiaries in hospitals were being discharged without provisions
having been made for out-patient care, dental care, physiotherapy,
or other treatment where such was indicated and necessary; that patients
were being discharged without having proper arrangements made for vocational
training where the patient in question was feasible for some kind
of training and was anxious to get it; that many such patients had to leave
a hospital when they were receiving no compensation or where adjustments
or readjustments of matters related to compensation needed to be carried
out here.</p>

<p class='c010'>These were the dominant and outstanding criticisms which followed
the issuance of General Order No. 26, and as a result of these criticisms,
it was considered advisable to issue a supplemental order correcting the
defects complained of. Accordingly General Order No. 26–A came out under
date of November 17, 1921.</p>

<p class='c010'>The re-actions to General Order No. 26 were as I have just stated and
came largely from the Bureau beneficiaries, from friends, relatives, and
allied agencies working in the field. The criticisms of General Order
No. 26–A, however, came largely from the hospitals and the District offices,
the hospitals particularly. There was an apparent contradiction between
the two orders. No. 26–A seemed to largely or entirely contradict the
provisions of the original Order No. 26. General Order No. 26 stated that
patients not requiring further hospital treatment should be given four
days to complete personal arrangements and then be discharged.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>General Order No. 26–A requires that before a patient is discharged
from hospital it should be determined whether or not he is in further
need of out-patient care; whether or not he is feasible and eligible for
vocational training and if he wanted training, that this should be arranged
before he is discharged, and that the necessary adjustments or
re-adjustments of all matters pertaining to a claimant’s compensation
be entirely completed by the time of his discharge from hospital;
and further it must be distinctly understood in carrying out all of this
that no unnecessary delay in discharge of patients would be allowed. A
pretty complex and contradictory situation you might say. However, between
the time of the issuance of General Order No. 26 and of General Order No.
26–A—to be exact, on October 14, 1921, a general order was addressed
by the Medical Division of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau to the several
Government services—the Surgeons General of the Army, Navy, U. S.
Public Health Service, the Superintendent of the National Homes for Disabled
Volunteer Soldiers, the Superintendent of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital,
and to the fourteen District Managers. The essential parts of this letter
are as follows:</p>

      <div class='line'>Dear Sir:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Referring to General Order No. 26 and to Paragraph No. 2,
which reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“All patients now in hospitals in your District, who do not
require further hospital treatment, will be given four days notice
to make their personal arrangements and will then promptly be discharged
from hospital. Each patient discharged under existing
Regulations will be furnished transportation to his bona fide legal
residence in the United States or to the place from which he was
hospitalized. Notification of such discharge will be sent immediately
by the Officer in Charge of the Institution caring for beneficiaries
of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau to the District Manager of the District
in which the institution is located.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>In complying with these instructions and before authorizing
discharge of patient of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau from hospital,
district Managers will determine:</p>

  <dl class='dl_3'>
    <dt>1st.</dt>
    <dd>Whether the patient is in need of out-patient, dental, physiotherapy, or other treatment,
    or convalescent care. If so, District Managers will make the necessary arrangements to

    </dd>
    <dt>2nd.</dt>
    <dd>Whether the patient desires vocational training: If so, his eligibility and feasibility
    will be determined and arrangements made for placing him in training promptly upon his
    discharge from the hospital.

    <dd>Necessary adjustment or readjustment of all matters pertaining to his compensation will
    also be completed promptly upon his discharge from the hospital.

<p class='c010'>In order to accomplish the above patients of the U. S.
Veterans’ Bureau will not be discharged from hospitals until
District Managers have been notified and the necessary arrangements
made by them for the determining of the above factors
upon which the District Managers will approve discharge and
notify the hospital accordingly.</p>

discharge of patients for disciplinary reasons.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>This supplementary letter—perhaps it did not reach you all—was
not as susceptible of misinterpretation as General Order No. 26–A. The
needs of the patients about to be discharged with reference to after-care
out-patient treatment, etc., are not matters which should take long to determine;
feasibility for training is also a matter capable of prompt determination;
eligibility or the right of a patient for training is a matter
that can be handled either before or after a patient’s discharge has been
effected, and the necessary adjustments or re-adjustments of matters relating
to compensation, while necessary of establishment before discharge
from hospital do not require that such patients must remain in hospital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>until actually in receipt of compensation. It simply means that the
important steps leading up to this action should be properly gotten
under way, and having done this, the completion of the compensation
status can be as readily carried out after discharge as before. Notwithstanding
the supplementary instructions following General Order
No. 26 still further conflict regarding the application of the two
orders in question in the District offices and in the hospitals was
apparent from reports received in the Central Office, and it was decided
to insert a further explanatory notice in the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau
Field Letter No. 20, of December 24, 1921. This notice was as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>Judging from letters that have reached the Bureau, there has
been some confusion with regard to the exact intent expressed in
General Orders Nos. 26 and 26–A.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rightly interpreted, these orders are in no wise contradictory.</p>

<p class='c010'>The intent of General Order No. 26–A is fivefold, namely:</p>

<p class='c010'>(1) To determine the eligibility of claimants for vocational
training.</p>

<p class='c010'>(2) To determine their feasibility for training.</p>

<p class='c010'>(3) To arrange for training when eligibility and feasibility
are established.</p>

<p class='c010'>(4) To accomplish everything necessary to adjudicate claims.</p>

<p class='c010'>(5) Provision for outpatient treatment when required.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All of these matters ought to be attended to before the patient
leaves the hospital, and with close co-operation and efficient administration,
both in the field and in the Bureau, this can be done,
and of course must be done without keeping the patient in the hospital
after his treatment is completed. Manifestly there is only one way
to accomplish this, and that is, to anticipate the discharge of the
patient a sufficient length of time in advance to provide for these
objects.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='under'>Feasibility</span> of training is to be determined preferably by the
Medical Officer in Charge of the hospital, or his assistant, and
means only that, in his opinion, the patient is physically and
mentally fit to receive vocational training.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The other requirements must be met by the Bureau or its
field representatives, but with the co-operation of the hospitals.
A representative will shortly be named at each hospital, who will
keep himself informed of the status of each patient’s claim to the
benefits enumerated and who will follow up all cases in which there
may be delay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Again reminding all concerned that anticipation is the key-note
of the action desired in these General Orders, the hope is
expressed that the objects outlined may be obtained, as nearly as
possible, before the patient is ready to be discharged.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Any discussion of the instructions of General Order No. 26 and
No. 26–A must take into consideration the reasons which led to the
issuance of those orders. The officials in the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau
had been convinced for sometime that a high percentage of patients were
being cared for in hospitals, and this applies particularly to contract
hospitals, whose necessity for remaining in hospital was not based upon
sound medical reason, and in many instances upon no real medical indication
at all. A number of factors were responsible for this situation,—the
rapid growth and development of the District offices required the
personnel therein to work at high pressure at all times; it has been a
continuous struggle to keep abreast of the volume of incoming correspondence,
with requests for hospitalization, application for compensation,
claimants crowding the doors, and a thousand and one other subjects. It
has been a struggle on the part of the District personnel to keep from
being swamped by the tremendous and ever increasing daily load. Hospitalization
was authorized and carried out both in contract and Government
institutions in cases of all character for treatment where the indications
for such were great and immediate, or were slight or nil, for ailments,
objective and subjective, imaginary and real, for physical examination
and report, for determination of compensability, and for information
concerning the connection with military service of a claimants
disability. The list grew so rapidly that patients were lost sight of.
Many claimants were hospitalized for examination and treatment, and
overlooked after examination and treatment had been completed. Contract
hospitals particularly, through lack of a proper and direct connection
in channels of communication between such hospitals and the District
offices, were carrying patients over long periods of time. Patients
got into contract hospitals for whom no proper authorization was ever
provided, and the records of whom were never clearly defined in the
District offices. The scattering of patients anywhere from one to a
considerable number in several hundred contract institutions in each
District extended the lines of communication between the Government
and the District Offices until it was practically impossible to keep the
contact clear. The Central Office in Washington felt that it was time to
take stock, and stock-taking at almost any time is an enlightening process.
The Director desired to remove claimants from contract hospitals;
he desired further to utilize as much as possible the existing Government
facilities which have been provided for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under date of September 1st, about the time of the issuance
of General Order No. 26 there were 9,592 patients in <span class='under'>862</span> private
hospitals; there were 18,698 patients in <span class='under'>92</span> Government hospitals.
Today there are <span class='under'>8924</span> patients in 757 contract hospitals and <span class='under'>20339</span> patients
in <span class='under'>92</span> Government hospitals. From these figures it would appear as
though the clearing out of hospitals, as provided for in General Order
No. 26, has not been productive of results. This, however, must be viewed
in the light of what is actually taking place in the field. About the
time of the issuance of General Order No. 26, or a little before, every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>District was putting into the field a Clean-up Squad for practically every
state, the function of which Squad was to make contact with all potential
beneficiaries of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau for the purpose of establishing
claims, of offering hospitalization for examination, for emergency treatment,
and for other situations. These Clean-up Squads served to feed a
considerably increased number of patients of all types into hospitals.
Anticipating that such period of hospitalization would be brief, they have
used contract hospitals because of this fact, and because of their location
in the near or immediate vicinity of the patients handled. The
turnover has thus been largely increased. The increase of patients in
Government hospitals has risen steadily at the rate of approximately 600
a month until it has reached the figure of  <span class='under'>20339</span> patients, as against <span class='under'>18698</span>
patients in the early part of September. There has been a slow but gradual
decline of patients hospitalized in contract institutions, notwithstanding
the very material influx into the hospitals by reason of the Clean-up
Squads just spoken of. It might appear to you who are actually caring for
patients in your institutions that notwithstanding the explanation of the
meaning of General Order No. 26 and 26–A, that the holding of a patient in
a hospital until all of the several matters necessary can be taken care of,
will result in undue delay in discharge. This doubtless would be true if
each hospital were required to assemble data called for and make the other
necessary provisions and forward the reports to the District office to
await return and receive transportation before a patient could be discharged.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the issuance of General Order No. 26–A and the supplementary instructions
it was contemplated in the Bureau here in Washington that a
representative of the District Manager would be necessary in each hospital,
at least, in those of considerable size, and some distance away from the
District office, in order that direct liaison between the District Manager
and the hospital in question might be maintained, it being the business
of this representative to see that matters of after-treatment, convalescent
care, feasibility for training, and necessary adjustments of compensation
matters will be properly taken care of prior to the time that it is actually
necessary to discharge the patient. This representative will keep
contact with the appropriate District office and handle transportation for
returning a claimant home or to point of hospitalization. Anticipation on
the part of the medical officers actually taking care of claimants in hospitals,
of the needs of each patient in respect to these necessary details
would enable the District Manager’s representative located in the hospital
to carry out the proper adjustments of these important matters and the
patient made ready for discharge at the proper time without delay. To make
effective the services of the Government hospitals in the functions which
they are carrying out, a thorough understanding of the problems involved is
very necessary and a sympathetic understanding of each other’s problems,
as between the District Managers and Hospitals together with a spirit of
co-operation and fair play is essential to the desired results, if not
an absolute prerequisite to the success of the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Many features of our work are, I recognize, trying and a thousand
and one annoyances are a part of each day’s work. Keeping before us at all
times the meaning of the work involved is a great aid to the elimination
of misunderstanding, and personal conferences serve to smooth out and adjust
overlapping of authority. One ex-service man maimed or injured,
replaced into his particular niche of our social fabric should make us
feel appreciative of what our work means, and the knowledge that we are
rebuilding men who have suffered in the service of our country, should
fortify us very strongly against the annoyances and trials which must
sink into insignificance when compared with the work done. I know that
you all realize this and that your every effort and energy is bent
to the accomplishment of the purpose for which we are all working together;
that we are making headway in the proper direction is beyond question; that
we are helping to rebuild the disabled is becoming more apparent as our
work goes along, and we all, I know, are not only proud that we are
having a part in this work, but feel privileged that our services are
helping to bring about these ends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon the conclusion of Dr. Guthrie’s paper, the subject-matter of
the several papers read during the morning session was thrown open to discussion,
the presiding officer remarking in this connection that full opportunity
would be given to all to freely express themselves. With reference to
the matter of the issuance of so-called conflicting orders, which had
been referred to, he stated that the administration of the Veterans’
Bureau is regulated by certain laws upon which these orders were based,
and that when such laws are changed, it of course becomes necessary to
revoke certain orders in force at the time. He added that the matter of
hospitalization, thrown suddenly upon the Public Health Service and the
U. S. Veterans’ Bureau is a tremendous undertaking and that those who
carry on this work are entitled to the sympathy of all good people.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON: wished to place himself on record as saying that there is
nobody who is in greater sympathy with the wounded soldier, whom he would
like to see receive all that a grateful Government can give, but that due
to the very liberality of the Sweet Bill, cases have crept in whereby
compensation is being received for disabilities in no way connected with
the service. He stated that the Sweet Bill does not clearly define what
the line of duty shall be and that he is amazed at the number of cases
that are being carried along and hospitalized; that he is of the opinion
that the gentlemen in Congress do not realize how liberal this act is and
that men would receive compensation for diseases which existed prior to
their coming into service. He offered the following motion amending
section 300 of the Sweet Bill, to be incorporated in a resolution to
Congress as coming from this body, which resolution was adopted:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span><em class='gesperrt'>Motion</em>:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>RESOLVED, that in considering the question of line
of duty, it should be understood that an officer of the
Army or Navy, or an enlisted man of the Army or Navy, who
has been accepted on his first physical examination after
arrival at a military station as fit for service shall be
considered to have contracted in line of duty any subsequent
determined physical disability, unless such disability
shall be shown to be the result of the patient’s
own carelessness, misconduct, or vicious habits at any
time, or to have been contracted while absent from duty
without permission, or unless the history of the case
shows unmistakably that the disability existed prior to
entrance into the service.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. G. H. YOUNG: stated that it has frequently been a shock to his
sensibilities to see the manner in which compensation has been
awarded to certain ex-service men who are not in any sense deserving;
that assuming John Doe had a disability when he came
into the service, it is now going on four years since his discharge
and if such disability was exaggerated in service he
should be compensated just as if he had been wounded in action;
that the question comes up as to how it can be determined as to
whether the exaggeration of his disability arose say during six
weeks, six months or eighteen months of his military service
or in the period of nearly four years which has since elapsed?
That he is of opinion that this applies especially to the in-patienthiatric cases.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. COBB: suggested that general discussion of the other subjects be
taken up and that this very important matter be brought up later.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. BREW: referred to the case of a man in hospital with a fracture
of the thumb, which was operated upon with the result that it
functioned properly and the man was not handicapped in the least.
After the operation, which resulted in his total rehabilitation the
man was awarded vocational training and drew $80 a month. He referred
to the case of another man who had been in every hospital he could reach,
obtaining transportation from the Red Cross when he could not otherwise
obtain it; this man was inducted into service at Jefferson Barracks and
had a military service of 28 days, of which 28 days he was in hospital
14 days, and his disability was amoebic dysentery, which he could not
have incurred at Jefferson Barracks; this man was in hospital for 18
months and has been drawing $130 a month for training, which he has
been taking for two years. Dr. Brew also referred to the case of a
negro, who had syphilis before he went into the service; that he is
as well as the average man of his type and is receiving a compensation
of $110 a month; that this man has benefited by his military service because
he has had a line of treatment that he would not have received in
civil life.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>DR. WHITE: (Speedway Hospital) thought that the matter of allowing the
space of six feet between beds should be adjusted, as this space will
greatly reduce the hospital capacity. He also referred to the matter
of rations for absentees and stated a man may be away a matter of seven
days without leave and asked whether or not the hospital shall charge for
that patient’s rations, as the dietary service must prepare for him
whether he is there or not, and there is always the possibility of his
return the next day; that it also happens that a patient on leave may
return two days before he is expected. He thought that if meals are
prepared they ought to be paid for.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. White also referred to losses of clothing which take place and
thought it was unfortunate that individual lockers were not supplied for
use of patients, as if they were supplied they could be rented to patients
at a nominal cost, thereby relieving the institution of the custody
of the clothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The large amount of paper work was also mentioned by Dr. White. He
stated that he understands that when a patient is sent to a hospital he
receives a compensation of $80 a month automatically, in which case he
cannot see the necessity for making additional physical examinations.</p>

<p class='c010'>With reference to the matter of admissions, transfer and discharges,
Dr. White expressed the opinion that officers should require a patient
to state whether or not he is receiving compensation; that in the matter
of transfers as well as admissions, officers should be required to state
in writing, specifically and distinctly, the reason why they desire cases
transferred. He mentioned one instance wherein it was stated that a
patient had a gunshot wound of the left thigh, and he simply had a scar
to show for it. He thought that officers should be required to state in
writing the hospitalization needed. Dr. White also referred to cases
where it is desired to discharge a man from a hospital for certain offenses,
stating that if this is done, compensation of course would be
stopped and the man will not feel kindly toward the particular hospital
which discharges him. He was of opinion that in such cases a hospital
should be required to terminate its own cases and not dump them off on
other institutions and stated that at the Speedway Hospital there is no
hesitation about reporting such cases as they are found, and if officers
who transfer patients would give specific reasons as to why patients
need hospital treatment, there will not be so many men coming into hospitals
who do not require treatment anywhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to G. O. 26, Dr. White inquired as to who is to decide the
feasibility and eligibility of patients who are ready to be discharged,
stating that he had been waiting for a representative of the Veterans’
Bureau to be sent to his hospital empowered and authorized to make awards
of compensation, as if medical officers are expected to do it, their
number will have to be increased; that a man should be sent from the
Veterans’ Bureau to attend to matters relating to training and who could
say definitely to a patient that he can have such and such training, as
it is absolutely necessary to have such a man and if he is provided it
will prevent a large number of complaints.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>DR. GUTHRIE: stated that he would like to have some discussion as to
whether the representative referred to by Dr. White should be a medical
officer or a layman; that Dr. White stated that he had expected the arrival
of such a representative for some time, and as the doctor is a young-looking
man, he thought that if he lived long enough he will see this representative
get there.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: mentioned that the Board of Hospitalization has an understanding
with the various Departments and the Veterans’ Bureau that these things
are to be settled by the Vocational Director, who, it is understood, is to
become as quickly as possible a part of the hospital personnel; that he was
of the opinion that the Board of Hospitalization came to the conclusion
that it was not material whether the vocational representative was a layman
or a medical man, but that he personally was of the opinion that upon
the judgment of a medical man a great deal depends for the answer that is
finally given; that he would like to encourage Dr. White with the thought
that the Hospitalization Board has this matter very definitely in mind in
order that the man needed may be provided.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. EVANS: stated that the matter just referred to was a part of the program
had been approved and was now awaiting the signature of the Director; that
the individual designated as Vocational Director in a hospital will be
responsible for contacting the men with regard to their compensation and
their preparation for vocational training; that he will confer with the
medical officers and of course should be directed by them, but he is
responsible for the work.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. GUTHRIE: was of the opinion that the location of these men in the hospitals
in connection with the work referred to is most valuable.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. DEDMAN: Stated that General Order No. 26 has been a wonderful help. In
connection with the matter of discharged he thought that four days would
be enough, because a man’s discharge can be anticipated and arrangements
made for his vocational training, provided a representative from the Veterans’
Bureau is furnished. He stated that everyone has the same ideals as
to the restoration to health of these ex-service men but that this matter
cannot function properly and we cannot attain the maximum for these men
unless we do work together in harmony and peace in hospitals; that when
these representatives come, it should be distinctly understood that they
are members of the official family and staff of the hospital; that these
representatives should not be medical men as a medical board can determine
the means and advisability of training, but that they should be well
versed in the subject in order that they may be competent to judge as to
what is best for a certain man to take up.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Dedman added that difficulty had been experienced in getting men
to leave the hospital. He mentioned the case of a boy who had been admitted
to the hospital with active tuberculosis, who was eventually rated as an
arrested case and told that he had received the maximum benefit, that this
boy did not want to leave the hospital and made a protest to his Congressman.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>DR. COOK: stated that he was going through his hospital one day and met a
big husky and asked him where he worked; that he replied he did not work
but was a patient; that this incident set him to thinking and he got his
discharge board working with the result that he reduced the number of
patients from 910 to 500; that in connection with existing requirements
to the effect that no patient would be discharged from a hospital without
going through a contact man, he was fortunate in having a man assigned
to him from the Veterans’ Bureau and every case of discharge goes through
his hands; that under this arrangement he has no difficulty in discharging
patients.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. EVANS: informed the Conference that there was on the Director’s desk a
ruling stating that personnel from the Veterans’ Bureau will be under the
commanding officers on hospitals.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. YOUNG: referred to G.O. 26, authorizing discharges from hospitals and
mentioned experiences where difficulty had arisen in this connection due
to the lack of adequate means being provided to enforce such order. He
mentioned cases that had come up where men who had received the maximum
benefit, would state that they were not going to be discharged; that these
cases would generally occur on the eve of a holiday, or on Saturday night
and the men would go into a ward and get into bed. He believed that in
such cases the hospital authorities should be given some means of enforcing
this order by the Veterans’ Bureau, as aid can not be had from the local
police who will not enter upon a Government reservation; that another way
would be through swearing out a warrant, but as these cases generally
occurred on Saturday and a warrant could not be sworn out until the following
Monday, a man is thereby enabled to stay four days longer.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. CHRISTIAN: stated that in his experience the police had not refused to
go upon the reservation and that he has had one of his staff sworn in as
a deputy sheriff; also, that upon the date named in the discharge order
the man affected is not officially in the hospital and is not rated as
present for the purpose of being fed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning transfers, Dr. Christian mentioned that authority for transfers
has changed a number of times and was of opinion that it would be
advantageous if stations like his could be given blanket authority to
transfer mental cases when they are not prepared to take care of them, as
it would relieve the medical officers of great anxiety and would save the
family of the man a great deal of torture; that this could be accomplished
in a few hours by telephoning to the nearest mental hospital and receiving
an answer in a short time as to whether or not a bed was available, all
of which would expedite the transfer of the patient; that it is now taking
too long to get transfers.</p>

<p class='c010'>He also stated that he appreciated the importance of the Inspector’s
Department, which is of wonderful benefit to the commanding officers.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>With reference to G.O. 26, he thought that the length of time prescribed
is too long, as with the generality of patients who have received
the maximum amount of treatment, it does not make a great deal of difference
as to how much notice they have as to when they are going to be discharged,
as the necessary arrangements can be made in a very short time
without any inconvenience; that there is, however, a certain class of
cases which very often takes advantage of the four days’ notice; that it
has been his experience that when four days’ notice is given it apparently
has no effect on the first day, on the second day the patient will begin
to develop symptoms, on the third day the symptoms are very much increased
and on the 4th day you get a letter from the patient’s Congressman.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. LASCHE: was of the opinion that all the authority needed is given by
G.O. 27 of the Veterans’ Bureau, which gives the medical officer in charge
considerable authority to enforce discipline; that the average patient,
however, chafes under the word “discipline”; that the gentlemen from the
Army and Navy have referred to the advantages of discipline. He stated
that he was on a discharge board for soldiers after they came home from
Europe and frequently heard them say: “Well, by Jove, we are away from
this —— discipline now;” that with all due respect to discipline that is
necessary in Army and Navy organizations, he does not believe that the
same degree of discipline is necessary after these men become beneficiaries
of the Veterans’ Bureau; that in a year’s time he has only had to apply
the provisions of G.O. 27 on one patient who was A.W.O.L. three times for
the period of twenty-four hours or more within thirty days; that he finally
discharged this man, who, however, subsequently applied for readmission
and was successful in obtaining it within two weeks and all the
patients at the institution know that this man got back after he was discharged.</p>

<p class='c010'>With reference to the question of Dr. Guthrie as to whether a layman
would serve successfully, Dr. Lasche was of opinion that the layman is the
only desirable person, as the medical man’s function is exclusively to
determine the vocational disability and after this is determined all the
other matters should be left to a layman, as they are more or less in the
nature of an investigation and a layman who is properly selected would be
much better able to run down and ferret out such matters; that it is
important, however, to select a man for this particular function who has
shown an adaptability for research along these lines, and, some of the men
who have been in charge of vocational centers do not possess the requisite
qualifications to decide as to visibility or eligibility in the matter of
vocational training.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. T. R. PAYNE: thought that the hospital brand had been placed on a great
many men in cases where it should not have been; that once you get a man
in a hospital he is going to repeat as long as he can. He referred to a
class of so-called gas bronchitis patients and stated that it is well
known that during the war all a man had to do was to say he had been gassed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>and receive a wound stripe, and this same man is now coming in to our
hospitals; that the office of The Adjutant General of the Army has no
record of such men being gassed; that he has no chest pathology. He
thought that these men should never have gotten into the hospitals and
should have been handled outside more by psychology than by doctors and
hoped that the dispensaries are going to keep these men out of hospitals;
that there is no doubt in his mind that a great many neurasthenics should
never have gotten into general hospitals; that the great trouble is the
compensation given those men places a premium upon their hospitalization;
that men are in hospital who have been discharged as having received
their maximum hospitalization; that these men have been taken out of vocational
training; that they would rather go back into hospital and get
$80 a month and three meals a day and be entertained several times a
week; that more care must be taken by doctors regarding the men they send
in to hospitals.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL IRELAND: stated that it has been found that there is no after effect
from gases and that Lieut. Col. Gilchrist, M.C., U.S.A., representing
the Medical Department of the Army in the office of the Chief, Chemical
Warfare Service, has data relative to this subject, which can probably be
obtained by writing him.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. LLOYD: offered the following resolution, which, however, was not
adopted:</p>

<p class='c010'>“That it is the sense of this body that the Federal Board
of Hospitalization recommend to the Director of the Veterans’
Bureau and to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service
the designation of an officer of each service to receive special
suggestions and recommendations from the field, criticisms also
of instructions contained in field orders, circular letters and
similar communications; these designated officers to constitute
a board for the consideration of these recommendations, with the
view of recommending to the Director the adoption of such as are
believed to be of value.”</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. CHRISTIAN: offered the following amendment to Dr. Lloyd’s resolution:</p>

<p class='c010'>“That these officers be detailed to the Veterans’ Bureau for
a limited period, say six months; that they be field officers.”</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. JOHNSON: moved that the resolution of Dr. Lloyd be laid on the table
indefinitely, which resolution was adopted.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. LLOYD: suggested that it would be well to have one man of each service
who could be advised as to what is the matter with certain general orders
and know that such matters will not be pigeon-holed but will receive
action.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>COL. BRATTON: was of the opinion that all suggestions relating to improvement
of service should go through the chief of the service. He stated
that no difficulty was experienced in this connection in the Army and
that it seemed to him that the chief of a bureau should know what was
going on.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. IRELAND: stated that contemplated changes affecting the hospitalization
of patients of the Veterans’ Bureau in the Army are always referred
to his office for review before they are issued.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. BLISS: thought that there should be a representative of the Veterans’
Bureau in all Government hospitals where there are Veterans’ Bureau
patients, which representative would not have anything to do with the
internal administration of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WILLIAMS: with reference to the matter of bed space in hospitals offered
a resolution to the effect that the question of floor space and
distance between beds be reconsidered by the Veterans’ Bureau, with
a view to the revision of the present requirements; that unnecessary
bed space is being provided and it should be cut down; that he believes
the allowance of six feet is necessary in respiratory cases and in
infectious cases, but that in the ordinary general ward he believed
that a little less space would be quite sufficient, as the larger requirement
will cut down the hospital capacity very materially. This
resolution was duly seconded.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. BARLOW: With reference to space allowed per patient, thought that
there should be a difference in accordance with the classes of patients;
that he has charge of a hospital for mental cases, and it would be
necessary to arrange for 100 square feet; these men are not suffering
from physical disabilities. He stated that the State Hospitals cannot
provide even fifty square feet of floor space and that it was absolutely
necessary for the Veterans’ Bureau to take out of the State hospitals
every insane patient they have.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. BLACKWOOD: concerning the allowance of six feet between beds, asked
if this was not intended to mean six feet between bed centers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following motion was adopted:</p>

<p class='c010'>“That the Federal Board ask the Veterans’ Bureau to reconsider
the question of bed space.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A motion was offered, which failed of adoption, to the effect that
the Director of the Veterans’ Bureau set aside a certain amount for the
reimbursement of unavoidable losses of property of ex-service men in
hospitals.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>DR. KRULISH: was of the opinion that if the foregoing resolution was
adopted, that more trouble would be experienced than before.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was further brought out that such a motion would carry no weight;
that it was thought the service had this question up once before and the
Comptroller’s office advised that no money arrangements could be made and
it was not believed that the Veterans’ Bureau could make allowance for
losses of clothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was also stated in this connection that in some institutions steel
lockers had been provided, a small deposit being required, which was given
back when the key was returned, under which arrangement very little clothing
was lost.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. HETERICK: stated that his institution is equipped with steel lockers
and a small deposit required, which is returned when the patient is discharged;
that the patient is told that due preparation has been made
for taking care of his clothing and it is in his custody; that the installation
of these lockers has reduced the theft of personal property
to a minimum; that some times, however, lockers will be broken into.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. CUMMING: “This afternoon we are going to consider administrative
policies. The first paper will be “Professional Service,” by
Dr. Lavinder,”</p>

<p class='c018'>ASST. SURGEON GENERAL C. H. LAVINDER:</p>

<p class='c029'>“The subject that has been assigned to me is very broad
in its scope, and the time is so limited, that if I may be permitted
I wish to tender a written paper.” Dr. Lavinder read the
article on “Professional Service”,</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a discussion of professional service, however brief, no thoughtful
medical man could forbear some comment on the present general status
of clinical medicine and its developments within the last few years. The
steady trend towards greater educational requirements, the development
of refinements in diagnosis and therapy and the straining after what are
believed to be higher scientific standards, creates in many minds some
uneasiness as to whether the medical profession may not, by such things,
be led astray and forget the very purpose for which clinical medicine
exists, that is, the comfort, welfare and relief of the patient. Such a
fear is by no means a groundless one. There is always a possibility that
the medical man may become so enamored of his refinements and of his
scientific methods as to forget that his business is the treatment of the
sick. It is a truism so trite as sometimes to be overlooked, that all
organization and all methods in clinical medicine have for their ultimate
end the care of the patient and everything else must be subordinated
to his interests.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaving this aside and omitting much, there are some things which
may be stated in a general way concerning professional service, understanding
that it is presumed such service is administered in hospitals
properly constructed, properly located and equipped, and operated for
the particular purposes which we have in mind.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>1. There are certain broad policies in this matter which are worthy
of some comment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The flexibility of hospitals is a matter of importance. The
Public Health Service has divided its hospitals into three general groups,
that is, hospitals for general medicine and surgery, for pulmonary tuberculosis
and for neuro-psychiatry. We have striven, however, even in these
broad groups to make such hospitals available, at least temporarily, for
any class of case which seeks admission. This has been especially true
with regard to pulmonary tuberculosis and we have been rather insistent
that every general hospital should set aside a certain number of its beds
for the care of such cases. A similar policy has been followed with regard
to neuro-psychiatric disorders. Even if the general hospital can be
made no more than a distributing point for these special classes of cases
it is, nevertheless, wise that such provision should be made. Consideration
has been given to the possibility of adopting a method which was
followed by the Army during the war, that is; specializing in hospitals to
much greater degree and organizing certain hospitals on such a basis that
they might be especially prepared, both in personnel and equipment, to
care for one or two classes of disorders. The patients with which we have
to deal, however, are by no means so easily transported and so easily congregated
in special groups. This method, therefore, while it deserves
much consideration, has not been found feasible in our work. Consideration
has also been given to the establishment of convalescent hospitals,
and while such institutions have much to commend them, they also possess
some very serious disadvantages, especially with the class of patients
with which we are now dealing. We have opened one such hospital which is
still in operation and is giving satisfactory service.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been a general policy of the Public Health Service, of
course, to seek in every way to establish in all of its hospitals standards
of professional service in full accord with the best modern practice. At
the same time we have sought to avoid the fostering of radical methods
which might verge on the field of fads. We have preferred to adopt a
somewhat conservative attitude in this regard and have been unwilling to
make use of methods until they had been fairly well tried out and established
as useful.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has also been a policy, as far as possible, to establish a
uniformity in professional service, at the same time doing nothing which
might interfere with individual initiative. General Uniformity in professional
service is desirable not only for administrative reasons, but
for professional ones as well.</p>

<p class='c010'>It goes without saying that we have felt the absolute necessity
of establishing a professional service which would be reasonable in cost.
The expenditure of money in professional service is, of course, wise.
At the same time it has seemed to us that any professional service which
could not be justified on the basis of economy was probably more than
necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>There is one other matter of general interest, which seems to us
of the highest importance, and that is the creation in all hospitals,
so far as possible, of a broad spirit of human charity and the stimulation
of any agency which would help in the creation of such an atmosphere.
We have, therefore, done everything we could to assist in the
formation of an efficient medical social service and in the furtherance
of recreational activities. It has seemed to us that the creation of such
an atmosphere in any hospital is a matter worthy of every effort.</p>

<p class='c010'>One other consideration of general significance is the ideal of not
discharging a patient from hospital until he has reached the maximum
benefit to be derived from such a form of treatment, and was ready for
discharge in a condition which would permit him to return to the outside
world prepared to assume, as far as possible, the burdens of daily life
and ready to make social readjustments. In other words, it has seemed
to us unwise simply to discharge a man upon recovery from an acute or
chronic illness without taking pains, through a medical social service,
to see that he was readjusted to the community on a basis which would
prevent his reversion to a state of ill health and perhaps his readmission
to hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. With regard to the application of professional service to the
actual treatment of sick in our hospitals, we have had in mind, in a
general way, some rather definite things. In the organisation of our
hospitals, whatever the type, we have arranged all of the professional
services to meet the demands of the institution. We have attempted to
adjust these professional services, so for as possible, to the need of
the particular hospital and the particular class of patient treated
therein and then properly to coordinate all of these various services
under competent chiefs, supplemented by attending specialists. An organization
so established should, we feel, meet any reasonable demands
which might be made upon the institution without an undue expenditure in
the matter of professional personnel.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have established many highly specialized services, including
dentistry. We have not overlooked such things as occupational therapy
and physio-therapy and, of course, have taken care to supply the necessary
modern laboratories, X-ray equipment and other matters which
are essential in the best modern professional service.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have, of course, not neglected such necessary accessories, in
the proper care of a patient, as good nursing and an adequate system
of supplying a well balanced ration, properly prepared and served.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have believed in doing much of this work that it was a matter
of economy as well as expediency to furnish as complete medical examination
as possible. These cases are compensable cases and the matter
of records as to their physical condition is of especial importance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>The veterans’ Bureau has felt the need of careful and complete examinations
as well as records which are dependable. Pains have been
taken, therefore, so far as possible, to take such examinations and
keep such records of all cases.</p>

<p class='c010'>In some of our hospitals we have felt the need of establishing
special services for special classes of cases, but have not extended
this any further than was necessary. For example: we have in one of
our general hospitals a special service on gastro-enterology. In another
we may have a special service on surgery, as applied to tuberculous
processes. Similar special services have been located in several places
to meet special demands and such a policy will, of necessity, continue.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most important of all we have striven in every way to secure a
qualified medical personnel, a matter of no small difficulty. The demand
for competent medical men is greater than the supply. In the operation
of such a large hospital system it is by no means easy to secure men
skilled in special lines of endeavor. We have, therefore, felt the need
many times of establishing some system of educating our medical staffs
in various matters and, while funds have not permitted the extension of
this system, we have availed ourselves of educational methods as far as
possible. Schools of various kinds have been held for short periods of
time and men have not infrequently been transferred temporarily to situations
where they might acquire a special knowledge. We have also encouraged
staff conferences and attempted to supply working libraries
and medical magazines to each of our hospitals—all with the idea of
stimulating among our entire medical personnel the desire to increase
their professional efficiency as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Finally, we have not overlooked the necessity for research.
Our funds have been too limited to do a great deal in this line, but we
have felt keenly the responsibility which rested upon us to do all that
was possible. Such activities have been carried on in a very small way
with the exception of one or two hospitals which might be really called
research hospitals, notably such a hospital as the one at Waukesha,
Wisconsin, where every effort is devoted to the diagnosis and treatment
of a definite class of Neuro-psychiatric disorders. This hospital
has been so organized as to permit the very highest type of modern
diagnosis and therapy.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: “This seems to me to be on opportunity to say a thing
or to which have been in my mind that I wish to express now. First,
this present administration has as one of its ambitions the best
Public Health Service in the world. I want you to know that, in your
engagements here, trying as they are, behind you is a determination
to help to develop an ideal Public Health Service, and every man who
is engaged in the service of the Public Health of the United States
should feel that he is engaged in the greatest service that can be
rendered to his country.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>For myself, I have a great ambition that somewhere there should
be established a post-graduate training department to which the members
of the Public Health Service of the United states could come for post-graduate
training. We want to be the highest type of doctors that are
to be found anywhere, and so today we have in contemplation the establishment
of a post-graduate training school in the city of Washington, to
which you can come to provide yourselves and equip yourselves with all the
new and better things that from time to time must develop.”</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON DEDMAN: stated that he felt that Dr. Lavinder’s paper was too
important to pass up without a comment or two; that one thing he
was struck with was the personal contact to be made with the patients
themselves. He said he believed this was a very important matter,
as the services of a doctor are absolutely worthless until he has
gained the patient’s confidence. He felt that the doctor should be
looked upon just as the family physician at home. He stated further
that when he first entered the work he made the following hospital
rules: 1—Kindness, 2—Cheerfulness, and, 3—Duty. Said that the
doctors should inject the feeling of friendship into the minds of the
men as much as possible. He stated that there ought to be a system
of uniform hospital regulations, that some hospital rules are not so
drastic as those of other hospitals, and that he believed there
should be a uniform regulation so that the disciplinary regulations
would be the same in one hospital as in another.</p>

<p class='c018'>ASST. SURGEON. L. L. WILLIAMS: stated that in reference to uniform disciplinary
regulations the character of the patients, the location of the
institutions and the construction of the premises are all factors
that affect the privileges to be given the patients. Believed there
could be no highly organized uniformity of regulations.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to specialized attention, the
hospital should be prepared to furnish any sort of special care possible.
He stated further that he believed that the specialized patient
in a general hospital is better off than if in a special hospital,
but that if he had a son who had a special ailment he would much
prefer him in a hospital which had upon its staff men in active practice
of the kind he was going to need.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. LOWNDES: said there was always some patient who would go out and
make trouble, that he had been investigated by the American Legion,
by ladies’ committees and by religious societies, all of whom he
invited to come to the hospital, as there was trouble if they were
told not to come. He said he had met with two criticisms: one was
that the nurses were particularly harsh, to which he replied that
he generally had trouble getting the patients to go out as some of
them generally fell in love with the nurses; the other that the
patients would not pay any attention to the Commanding Officer when
he made inspections.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>GEN. CUMMING: “The next subject “Nursing” will be presented by the
Superintendent of Army Nurses, Major Julia C. Stimson.”</p>

<p class='c018'>MAJOR STIMSON: read the paper “Nursing”, as given herewith:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The subject of nursing in relation to the care of the ex-service
man is a very big one and can scarcely be handled adequately in the ten
minutes allotted to it. There are, however, certain phases of it that
can be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'>The response of the nursing profession to the call of the country
during the time of war is well known, and the character of the achievements
of the 25,000 trained women who entered the government services at
that time has been often recounted, but little has been told of the
patriotic devotion to duty that has been exhibited by nurses since the
Armistice. I have not come today to bring bouquets and laurel wreaths,
but I do wish to call attention to the marvelous development of one
branch of governmental nursing work under conditions that in many instances
were harder to bear than most war conditions, and to ask for the
service the recognition and cooperation it deserves. At the present time
there are more nurses in the U.S. Public Health Service, (1796), than there
are in the combined nursing departments of the Army, (774), and the Navy,
(488). The figure given me for the present Public Health nursing staff
is about 1800, an expansion from forty odd at the time the service was
authorized to care for ex-service men, on March 3, 1919 by Act of Congress.
To realize the full meaning of this expansion and the development of the
organization required to manage the service, it is only necessary to recall
the fact that in the spring of 1919 when the Public Health Service
called for volunteers for its Nursing Service, the Army and the Navy were
both discharging from their Nurse Corps great numbers of women. In one
month alone in that year 2500 nurses were demobilized from the army.
They were all tired, worn-out women. You all recall the state of mind
of both the soldier and the officer during those months, when morale was
at its lowest ebb, because of homesickness, fed-upness, and desire to
get back to civil life. Nurses as well as men were full of complaints,
and to be freed from governmental control was the thing that to all of
them seemed the ultimate good. Moreover, many who came from overseas
had been marking time for weeks, awaiting orders for the breaking up of
their units, and embarkation, and upon their arrival home they found
their communities, which they had left so short of nurses, were clamoring
for their services.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under such conditions was presented the need of the ex-service
man. A new federal nursing department asked them to give up their
personal desire for freedom, their longed-for plans, and to enter—what?
and to do—what? It is hardly necessary to describe the kind of hospitals
these nurses were asked to enter, nor the conditions under which
they were to live.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>You would scarcely believe the details that I could tell you unless you,
too, have heard the accounts of the able Superintendent of Nurses of the
Public Health Service. You know, perhaps, what some of the old Marine
hospitals are like, and some of you know some of the old Army hospitals
taken over by the Public Health Service were like. You don’t know, I am
sure, about the utterly unworthy and unsuitable quarters and messing arrangements
for nurses which many staffs have had to endure, and still
do endure in some instances. The fact that there are now 1800 nurses in
the service bears witness to the clearness of her vision of the need on
the part of the Superintendent of the Corps, and her valiant presentation
of it, and to the assistance given her by the American Red Cross Nursing
Service which has spread the call and facilitated recruiting.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Nurse Corps of the Army and Navy were old, established departments,
with traditions and customs behind them, with a status recognized
by all in the service and honored by officers and men alike for their
many years of efficient work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nurse in the U. S. Public Health Service had no such advantage,
and to her and her associates and to the officials who have championed
her cause against what have at times seemed almost unbearable difficulties
too great praise cannot be given.</p>

<p class='c010'>General Sawyer has asked me to present the difficulties that lie
in the way of the kind of nursing service to the veteran that ought to
be given, and to suggest if I can, a plan for meeting these difficulties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The greatest problem of the nursing care of the ex-soldier is not in
the Army and the Navy, because the proportion of the veterans patient to
the regular Army and Navy patient in those services is so low that it
presents no particular problem. It is, of course, in the U.S. Public
Health hospitals that the problems exist most noticeably.</p>

<p class='c010'>First we must consider the type of patient. We are told that
neuro-psychiatric, contagious, and tuberculosis cases predominate. Right
here is one difficulty as far as nurses are concerned. To contribute the
highest type of service to people so afflicted requires that the living
conditions, the mental and physical recreation and up-building of the
nursing staff, be of the finest order. I think that this is conceded
by all who consider the long hours during which the nurse is in close
contact with the patient and who realize that no individual, barring
none, has so large an opportunity for personal influence upon patients as
the nurse.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nurses who are employed for the care of the veteran should be of
the highest grade. Not only should they meet all the professional and
technical requirements, but they should be especially qualified in all
phases of rehabilitation and reconstruction, both mental and physical.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>They should have an especial knowledge of the problem of the tuberculosis
patient, not only as an individual sick man, but in his relation to
society. They should be thoroughly cognizant of the magnitude and urgency
of the problem of social diseases, and without an ability to help the
neuro-psychiatric patient redirect his interests into the world of reality
and to correlate himself and his environment, they are failing in their
whole duty to their patient.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the present conditions it is probably not an easy matter to get
such super-nurses in any great numbers, and even were it possible to secure
them, it is not likely that they could be long retained. The turnover
in the nursing service in hospitals caring for veterans is unduly
large, the reports show. This has been due in some degree to physical
breakdown, and also to dissatisfaction with conditions, including uncertainty
as to their status and fears for its future. What, then, is to be
done? The answer is not so hard to find. Locally, it is comfortable
living quarters, reasonable hours, good food, the right sort of recreation,
adequate pay, and opportunity for advancement and improvement.
Nurses, like all other professional workers, are coming to recognize that
in order to live up to their highest ideals and to give their best services to
afflicted humanity, it is essential to make provision for continual
growth, and that from time to time added inspiration and education
are necessary. Courses of special study are advocated, therefore, for
all nurses, especially for those caring for veterans or any other particularly
difficult group of patients. Opportunity for post-graduate study
is considered a necessity in the Army for both officers and members of
the Nurse Corps, and it is even more important in the U.S. Public Health
Service. In some hospitals of this service special courses have been
conducted for nurses with marked success, but particular emphasis should
be given to this phase of meeting the nursers’ problems. For before a
nurse can help to reconstruct a distorted mental outlook and restore a
normal attitude toward life, she, herself, must have an understanding
and a sympathy and a power to help that can only come from steady inspiration,
constant study, and serenity of mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Second in importance locally is the recognition on the part of the
commanding officer of each hospital and each member of the hospital staff
of the real place of nurses in the endeavor to return the patient to
normal health and life, and emphasis upon an attitude of helpfulness
and cooperation in all matters concerning them. Only those who have
served in hospitals where the commanding officer was heart and soul in
sympathy with the problems of the nursing staff and concerned with every
detail that might work for its well-being, can know what a harmonious,
helpful atmosphere can exist, and how the spirit of courteous recognition
and mutual respect can permeate from the commanding officer to every
member of the personnel. For is not the nursing group usually the largest
group in every hospital, and will not the attitude of the nurses give
the tone to the hospital?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>Commanding officers should remember that in their hands and their’s alone
rests the regulation of this tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>In all the presentation of the general subject of the care of the ex-service
man, at this conference, little if any mention has been made of the
part of the nurse. Right here in this very fact, perhaps, rests one of the
largest snags that lie in the way of the best service to the veteran. Think
for one moment of the situation if there were no nurses to work side by side
with the medical man and to cooperate with him in securing for the patient
that which he, with his special preparation, considers necessary for his
healing. What results would be obtained? The time has passed when the need
of professional nursing in the care of the sick is a debatable question.
And yet nursing, as vital to the modern scientific restoration of the war
veteran, has not been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here at headquarters is where the greatest progress toward the
solution of the nursing problem can be made,—1st, in the recognition of
the problem and its importance, and 2nd, in a sympathetic, concerned, business-like
attempt to solve it by the method that is most sure to bring
about success,—namely the conference method, the collecting of advice from
experts on the subject, the formulation of their suggestions, and an endeavor
on the part of all concerned to put these suggestions into practice.</p>

<p class='c010'>You, in this new governmental organization, which has for its aim the
highest type of service to veterans and their restoration to complete living,
have a chance to develop a nursing department that should set the standard
for all the departments of federal nursing as well as for civilian institutions.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. CUMMING: “Discussion will be offered by Mrs. Higbee”.</p>

<p class='c018'>MRS. LENAH S. HIGBEE, Superintendent, N.N.C.: stated that the subject hardly
needed discussion, that it would almost seem that she could not amplify
it, but that was what she was going to attempt to do. She spoke on
“Nursing”, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Since the nurse viewpoint of the treatment of patients under the
Veterans’ Bureau is considered sufficiently important to be discussed, it is
a matter of regret that the chief nurses of the hospitals have not been summoned
to this important conference. Of course, the nursing subject comes
directly under the Commanding Officers of the hospitals but in presenting
the more intimate views of the nurses, the opinions of the chief nurses
would be more helpful than the opinions expressed through the medium of the
superintendent whose knowledge of the situation is obtained from reports.</p>

<p class='c010'>My knowledge of the situation we are discussing is obtained from reports.
Letters have been sent to the various chief nurses requesting definite information
on this subject and asking if any particular presentation could be
made to this important body which would be helpful.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span><span class='under'>NURSING.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At the Naval Hospitals which have had the greatest success in treating
the Service beneficiaries, the Commanding Officers have put a frank presentation
of the situation to the patients, pointing out the necessity for
certain restrictions and discipline, and urging cooperation. This preliminary
presentation by the Commanding Officers when followed by the kind
yet firm supervision of the ward officers and also by the tactful, helpful
attitude of the nurses, who in turn cooperate with the welfare and vocational
workers, in time break down the attitude of opposition, resentment,
and destructive criticism which many patients have when first hospitalized.
The chief nurses have stated that the care of the patients means only
“more patients.” There is no special problem in dealing with them and under
the above conditions, they accept the necessary discipline and restriction
which are fundamental if hospital treatment is to succeed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would seem, therefore, that the problem, as has already been
pointed out, exists chiefly in the U. S. Public Health Hospitals where the
greater number of patients from the Veterans’ Bureau are receiving care
and treatment. A large percentage of these patients would correspond to
our Navy ambulant cases and among the remainder (as has already been
stated) the neuro-psychiatric and tuberculous patients predominate.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is considerable discussion among doctors, at present, regarding
the fundamental qualifications which the trained nurse should possess;
and there have been charges of over-education and a tendency to commercialism
which result in unrest and in losing sight of the basic principles of
their profession. The charge of commercialism is so unworthy of the
medical profession that I shall let it pass without comment but I do not
consider it beside the present question to touch upon the statement of
over-education. It may be conceded that a nurse, possessing a preliminary
graded school education, who has been carefully taught for two or three
years in an accredited hospital, is able to give nursing care, under
medical supervision, to the sick bed patient. Her greater value to the
physician and to the patient because of greater knowledge due to higher
educational standards need not be discussed here. However, it should be
conceded, also, that the influence of nurses on the patients of the Veterans’
Bureau is more constructive mentally and morally than is the influence
of nurses who care for the acutely sick; which is, usually,
particular personal care for a comparatively brief period. To care for
convalescent and Veterans’ Bureau patients is to serve long hours of duty
in which little change in the physical condition of the patients is noted;
and yet so great is this responsibility, so important is the work from
humanitarian and economic viewpoints that the nurses must ever be on guard
against the insidious lack of interest which comes from routine care; and
they must keep themselves so alert that their great opportunities for
personal influence among these men shall not be neglected in any particular.
With any degree of sickness, there is distorted judgment and predisposition
to give undue stress to trifles. The educated nurse knows this and
knows also that the semi helplessness of protracted convalescence and the
resultant sense of dependency, are among the chief factors which must be
considered in dealing with these special patients. She must influence the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>patients to be receptive to hospital restrictions; she must counteract
the tendency to destructive criticism and disloyal statement; she must
be sympathetic but not maudlin; she must recognize that they are ill but
she must not encourage helplessness: she must suggest activity and encourage
pride in endeavor and accomplishment. She must present the best
viewpoint to the particular patient and this means an individual understanding
of him and his needs. Only educated nurses (meaning that the aim
of education is to develop the faculties of the mind and body) who have
courage, refinement and dignity, who are loyal to their country without the
stimulus of war, and who strive to maintain the high ideals of their profession
can be definitely successful in co-operating with other agencies
to restore these men to health. Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of the
ex-Service men cannot be an affair of merely rearranging tangible elements,
such as food, money and clothes: It is by example, by encouragement to make
an effort to overcome helplessness, an explanation of the reasons for
necessary treatment and restrictions, that the nurse will succeed in helping
to replace quiescent dependence with the unsleeping desire and motive
of service as active citizens. More and more it is recognized that we must
look to education to destroy irrational suspicion and to restore to health
and sanity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Public Health Nursing Service has been established a comparatively
short time and yet under the Surgeons General of that Service and due in a
great measure to the indefatigable efforts of the present superintendent
and because of the high professional standard she has always maintained,
more qualified nurses are attached to this Service at the present time
than in the combined older services of the Army and Navy Nurse Corps.
Having procured these nurses who, for the most part, it is believed, accept
the additional responsibilities which the care of such patients involve,
every effort that is made to retain them is worth while; since their value
increases with length of service. From an economic viewpoint, if for no
other reason, efforts should be made to give these nurses adequate payment
for trained service; to provide living conditions which they require as
educated and refined women; to recognize that rest and recreation are
necessary if the physical standards and morale are to be maintained; to
acknowledge their professional status and to give recognition to them as
co-workers with the medical profession. With these requirements satisfactorily
adjusted by those who have the power of formulating the necessary
rules and regulations, the work of the nurses who care for the maimed
bodies and sick minds of the patients of the Veterans’ Bureau will be
productive of even greater beneficent results than have already been
obtained;—for such nurses seek to maintain the fabric of the world; and
in the result of their unselfish efforts is their prayer.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>MISS LUCY MINNIGERODE, Superintendent of Nurses, U.S.P.H.S., gave a
further discussion of “Nursing”, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Major Stimson has placed before you some of the most urgent
problems and difficulties existing in the Nursery Service of Public
Health Service hospitals dealing with the ex-service men.</p>

<p class='c010'>The difficulties of the problem can be realized and understood
only by those who are in close association with the Services, and
that the Nursing Department of the Public Health Service has been
able to accomplish even a measure of success has been in a large
manner due to the co-operation, counsel and advice given by the
Superintendents of the established Nurse Corps of the Government.</p>

<p class='c010'>On March 3, 1919, the Public Health Service had available 1500
beds in 23 hospitals, and practically no nurses. Chief nurses were
unknown in any of the hospitals. There was no machinery for the recruiting
of nurses. In regular Service hospitals, there were no
quarters for nurses, and the Service is still concerned over a
solution of these difficulties. At the present time, there are 1796
nurses in the hospitals operated by the Public Health Service.</p>

<p class='c010'>As has already been said, the problem of giving the most efficient
care to the disabled ex-service men in the hospitals of the Public Health
Service is a little different from that of the Army, due to the fundamental
differences in the organization of this corps of nurses.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Nurse Corps of the Public Health Service is a civilian
organization, pure and simple, though 99%, probably, of the nurses
now serving in the Public Health Service are ex-service nurses and
familiar with the problems of the care of ex-service men.</p>

<p class='c010'>The aim of the Nursing Department of the Public Health Service
is to give as efficient nursing care to the patients in these hospitals
as can be given, to see that the nurses cooperate in every possible way
with those responsible for the care of the patients—that is, the Medical
Officers in Charge,—to recruit a sufficient number of qualified
nurses to meet the needs of the Service, and to recommend the establishment
of such policies in the Nursing Department as will increase the
efficiency of the nursing corps. The co-operation of the Medical Officer
in Charge is essential; his sympathy with and support of the Chief Nurse
must be unquestioned, if the nursing service is to reach the greatest
efficiency. The place of the nurse in the administrative unit of the
hospital should be clearly and definitely defined, understood and observed.</p>

<p class='c010'>One great difficulty confronting this department is the lack of
nurses specially trained in the care of neuro-psychiatric and tuberculosis
patients, who constitute a large proportion of our patients. To
partly meet this need, a school for nurses conducted at Oteen in September
1921, was organized and, while this school was most successful, it barely
touched the fringe of our necessities. The Service is considering a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>similar course in neuro-psychiatric nursing as soon as there is established
a station where all conditions, quarters, lecturers and teaching facilities
can be guaranteed to produce the desired result.</p>

<p class='c010'>One piece of nursing work which has been far-reaching in its effects,
was the establishment of a Public Health Nursing Unit in the
office of the Supervisor of District #4, for the purpose of making contact
with the claimant of the then Bureau of War Risk Insurance, with a
view to giving the claimant, who for any reason was not hospitalized, the
benefit of health supervision and health instruction. The success of the
work of this unit more than justified its establishment by the U. S. Public
Health Service.</p>

<p class='c010'>The type of nurse needed for this Service is the broad-minded woman,
cultured, well trained, with those qualities of mind and heart which
would enable her to grasp the tremendous responsibilities in the work we
are trying to do—who will be sympathetic, but firm—who will be able
to emphasize the need for obedience to orders for treatment—who can be
friendly, without familiarity, and loyal to the highest ideals of her
profession.</p>

<p class='c010'>The turnover is too large, by far, and is due in some measure to
conditions which are unavoidable, since they are the result of the sudden
expansion of the Service, the need for immediate action, and the great
difficulty in securing desirable hospital stations, both from the standpoint
of construction and location. These conditions are adjusting
themselves gradually, and a distinct improvement in service and morale
in the Nursing Department, a clearer understanding of the many problems
which confront the administration and the Service in the effort to give
the best medical care and treatment to disabled veterans of the World
War, is evidenced; and, at the present time, the U. S. Public Health Service
is able to keep the nursing force up to the necessities of the Service.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is believed, however, that uniformity, throughout the organizations
caring for these patients would go far toward establishing a more
satisfactory service, and it is hoped that this meeting of all connected
with and interested in the care of ex-service men will succeed in bringing
about this desired result.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the final analysis, however, it is conceded that the responsibility
for the proper and successful conduct of these hospitals rests with
the Medical Officers in Charge, and I can truly say in behalf of the
nurses of the Public Health Service, that the nursing section will cooperate
in every possible way to promote the successful organization of
the hospital program, and to assure this meeting that the nurses of this
Service will continue to “carry on” and to render all assistance in their
power toward the accomplishment of this result.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>GEN. CUMMING: asked for discussions, stating that only two minutes would
be allowed for each.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: stated that the women were very anxious to have their
suggestions.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. BLACKWOOD: stated that he wished to pay his tribute to the splendid
work that has been done by the nurses. He said he had experienced hospital
work when they were dependent upon the most undesirable man that
could be found to take care of the sick. The man who could not do anything
else was the one that took the place of the nurse. He also told
his experiences in Boston when the influenza epidemic came, how in less
than a month over 1300 cases were being treated by a staff of nurses
scarcely larger than before, how the women worked day and night without
rest and often without food, and how many of them lost their lives
in the struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stated that one of the most important questions confronting us
today is the question of pay of the nurses, that they had not been recognized
in the way that they should be, that stenographers whose work is
not as valuable receive from $100 to $150 a month and nurses from $60
to $100, and that effort should be made to pay them more in proportion to
their qualifications. He stated that the charwomen received more than
the nurses.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stated further that the ratio of nurses to the number of patient
which had been stated as 1–10 was too much to expect in hospitals such
as his, where only about 15% of the patients were bed patients.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. EASTMAN: stated that this should be one nurse to every ten bed patients.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON STITES[STITT?]: said he did not believe any Commanding Officer could run
a successful hospital without the cooperation of the Chief Nurse. He
spoke also on the statement previously made “Kindness without familiarity”,
stating that if too friendly some patients think others get more
attention because of familiarity with the doctor, nurse or attendant.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON HEDDING: gave the situation at Ft. Bayard, ten miles from anywhere,
with 1100 patients and 86 nurses taking care of them. He stated
that the Public Health Service had authorized the keeping of 50 riding
horses. He said that the nurses were happy, that the men were happy,
and that many nurses were asking to come to Ft. Bayard.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. CUMMING: asked Captain Wieber to talk.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. WIEBER: stated that he was from Ft. Lyon, Colorado, 7 miles from
the nearest city, an establishment with 400 patients at the present
time and nurse corps of 21. He said that the nurses were happy and content
with the work given them. He also wished to give his tribute to
the field and other nurses in the service. He stated he had had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>same experience as Dr. Blackwood in the early nursing service, and that
some of the men who took care of the sick were half idiots. He said he
fully realized now the value of female nurses, and believed he could not
get along without them.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. CUMMING: “That next subject is a very important one—‘Diet’—to be
presented by Miss Clara M. Richardson, Asst. Supt. of Dietitians,
U. S. P. H. S.”</p>

<p class='c018'>MISS CLARA RICHARDSON: read the following paper—“Diet”.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The subject “Diet” is a rather broad term and would suggest a
variety of different phases, all of which might be equally interesting.
Let us consider the subject however in its relation to the ex-service man
and the care given him in hospitals established for his benefit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among these patients we find the necessity for a wide variety of
diet, ranging from the more common types as liquid, soft and light to
the more complicated pathogenic diets. In what are termed the General
Hospitals are found patients suffering from many ailments such as
nephritis, diabetes, colitis and many gastric disturbances. In some
Public Health Service Hospitals, as many as four hundred special diets
are served daily. In planning and equipping new buildings provision
should be made for such a volume of work. It is impossible to satisfactorily
serve many special diets from a general kitchen without proper
facilities. Careful planning is not only necessary in the kitchen, but
also in the serving and dining rooms. The patient on regular diet who
may, perhaps, be eating corned beef and boiled potatoes is not likely
to see his neighbor eating broiled steak and mashed potatoes, without
making some comment. If this is not handled carefully, serious trouble
may result. Where there are a number of small dining rooms it will be
found wiser to use some of them for special diets.</p>

<p class='c010'>In one hospital the large mess hall was divided into sections. There
happened to be a number of doors, over each of which were placed signs
reading—Diabetic Diet, Nephritic Diet, etc. This arrangement worked
very satisfactorily, the patients filing in in an orderly manner wherever
their particular diet was indicated. This is a matter which is entirely
dependent on the construction of the hospital however.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course, care must always be taken that patients on regular diet
who want a few extras do not slip into a special diet dining room. In a
hospital too large for the dietitian to easily recognize her patients,
this may be regulated by a pass of some description. Often times the
Officer of the Day in making his inspection of meals may discover one of
these visitors.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Not only must we consider the patient who comes to the dining room,
the bed-ridden patient is perhaps worthy of even greater consideration.
His appetite must be coaxed, his tray must be attractive, and above all,
his food must be hot or cold, as the case requires. The satisfactory
conveyance of food from kitchen to patient is a problem in all hospitals.
Many institutions are so arranged that it is necessary to serve a few
trays in almost every corner of the building. In such cases, it is well
nigh impossible to attain the desired results. The ideal arrangement is
one whereby the sick patients are focussed at a point near a kitchen. If
Medical Officers would arrange this, other conditions permitting, they
would find that many of the difficulties of food service would be eliminated.</p>

<p class='c010'>A very successful development of this method in a hospital of a
thousand bed capacity was recently brought to my attention. There were
probably about two hundred patients on special diet, all served from a
central diet kitchen. Trays were all set up under the direct supervision
of the dietitian—a card bearing the patient’s name was placed in one
corner, and the tray was immediately taken from the kitchen directly to
the patient. As a result, patients from other parts of the hospital made
every effort to be put on wards thus served.</p>

<p class='c010'>The preparation of satisfactory menus and procuring of the requisite
foods for special diet cases of course necessitates buying certain
fruits and vegetables out of season. It also increases the number of
chops, steaks, etc. used. It must be expected that the ration expenditure
of a general hospital where such cases are cared for will be proportionately
higher than where few special diets are served, as for instance in
a neuro psychiatric hospital. It must also be expected that the ration
of a hospital caring for tubercular patients will be higher in accordance
with the increased amount of eggs and milk consumed. It is usually
necessary to make special effort to tempt the appetite of this type of
patient—he often is not hungry and is apt to waste his food. The market
conditions in different localities will also be found to have a very
direct bearing on the cost of the ration. The central northwestern states
provide the best and cheapest market in the country. A menu which might
cost 54¢ in this section would perhaps run 20¢ higher in some other locality.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the preparation of menus, too much stress cannot be laid on the
value of fresh fruits and fresh vegetables. Of course, it is necessary
to use dried and canned goods to a certain extent, but care should be
taken that the fresh articles are not entirely eliminated. The patient
will probably say that he does not like salads. They are good for him,
however, and after a little persuasion he will learn to like them, and
will often ask for them. The personality of the dietitian counts for much.
If she will go among the patients, talk with them in the dining room and
let them know that she is really interested in them, they on their part,
are ready to cooperate. Such cooperation is absolutely necessary, for
upon the attitude of the patient depends the atmosphere of order and
quiet in the dining room. An undercurrent of dissatisfaction is sure to
result disastrously.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>Another important factor in the success of the dining room service
is the appearance of the room itself. I once saw a group of patients
moved from a big barn of a mess hall, which was too large for the number
accommodated and which could not be made attractive, to a smaller dining
room, new and freshly painted, with curtains at the windows, and flowers
on the tables. Those boys who had been noisy and boisterous in the first
room, were as quiet and orderly as one could wish in the second.</p>

<p class='c010'>We find in these hospitals every kind of patient from the boy who
on account of religion does not eat certain foods, to the boy who eats
anything he can procure, regardless of whether he is on a diet or not.
Dietetic treatment in the latter case is practically impossible, while
the former is usually very reasonable and gives little trouble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again we find the patient who is earnestly trying to improve his
condition. If his ailment requires careful feeding, he may come to the
dietitian to talk over with her the question of his diet. Here is an
opportunity for the trained dietitian to give helpful instruction concerning
the dietetic value of different kinds of food as they pertain to
his particular case.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ward surgeons may in may cases render valuable assistance to
the dietitian in her problems, by instilling in the patient a confidence
in her judgment. Of course, the doctor must himself feel sure that his
confidence is not misplaced. There should be the closest cooperation
between the ward surgeon and the dietitian. She should confer with him
as to special diets, and thru him should ascertain the progress of the
patients on those diets.</p>

<p class='c010'>There should also be a complete understanding of just what is meant
by liquid, soft and light diets. Experience has taught us that doctors,
nurses and dietitians from different localities do not always give the
same interpretation to these terms. It will save much confusion for all
concerned if some standard is agreed upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of diet in these hospitals therefore resolves itself
into three problems—first, an effort to secure the foods necessary for
a wide variety of diet; second, an effort to serve these foods in a
wholesome, appetizing manner amid attractive surroundings; and third, an
effort to instill in the ex-service man a feeling of contentment and
satisfaction which will go far as an aid to dietetic treatment.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>MR. J. D. SULLIVAN, of St. Elizabeths Hospital, gave the following discussion
“Diet and the Service of Foods, at St. Elizabeths Hospital”.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In preparing menus and estimating the amounts of foods needed
for the population of St. Elizabeths Hospital, we base our calculations
on the standard dietary tables, as published by the office of Home
Economics, and the experimental stations of the department of Agriculture.</p>

<p class='c010'>From extensive investigations carried on by the experts on dietetics,
it has been found that the average man using much muscular energy
in work or play, will require food sufficient to supply 4000 calories
of energy daily; the average woman using much muscular energy, will
require 2700 calories; the average man doing little or no work 2700
calories; the average woman or girl doing little or no work, will require
2100 calories.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many of our patients are engaged daily at some work, and they lead
a fairly active life; their food requirements, together with the employees
of the hospital, can safely be calculated from the standard
dietary tables.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those amongst the hospital patients whose mental and physical condition
is such that they require special attention and care, the food
for them is prepared and served under the direct supervision of
Dietitians specially trained for this work, and the amounts and kinds
of food used is in accordance with each patient’s individual needs as
ascertained by observation from day to day.</p>

</table>

<p class='c010'>A diet made up of foods in this proportion will be sufficiently
bulky, and will furnish the right proportion of protein, fats,
carbohydrates, mineral matter, and vitamines.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the report of the daily average per capita consumption of foods
used will show we use slightly more than the amounts considered sufficient
according to the standard dietary tables, because of the mental
condition of many of our patients there is apt to be a considerable
amount of food unavoidably wasted; also approximately three-fourths of
the population are male adults, and for this reason they require more
food than would be needed for an evenly mixed population.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>From the investigations carried on in the office of experimental
stations, the conclusion has been drawn that the total amount of protein
needed every day is estimated to be 100 grams; one-half or 50 grams is
taken in the form of animal foods, the remainder is taken from the
cereals and vegetable foods.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is well to encourage the use of cereal foods, especially where
economy is to be considered, and they should be used as freely as can be
without making the diet one-sided.</p>

<p class='c010'>The use of cereals and vegetables increase the wholesomeness of the
diet, by providing the minerals, and the bulk necessary for the normal
digestion of the more concentrated food materials, and makes the diet
more varied and attractive.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the use of the cereal foods, bread should have the first consideration;
the best bread that can be obtained should be provided;
bread that is well flavored, light, of good texture, and well baked.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is also well to remember that large quantities of cereal foods
may not seem attractive if served alone; they may be made very appetizing
if combined with small amounts of the more highly flavored or
seasoned foods. A well seasoned soup may lead to the eating of a large
quantity of bread. A little savory meat or fish, or a small quantity of
cheese, may be used to flavor a fairly large dish of rice or macaroni.”</p>

<p class='c018'>MISS FLORENCE D. HANKS of the U.S. Naval Hospital at Annapolis:
She stated that cooperation is the big thing, that without it the
dietitian is helpless. She said she has received the most hearty cooperation
from the Chief Nurse and Commanding Officer, and stated further
that in different hospitals liquid, soft and regular diets are
different, and that it must be immediately understood just what the
doctors mean.</p>

<p class='c018'>MISS GENEVIEVE FIELD, Head Dietitian of the Walter Reed General Hospital:</p>

<p class='c010'>At Walter Reed there are all kinds of patients to deal with. They
have at least one dietitian present at every meal, and the patients feel
free to bring comment or criticism to them at any time. In the wards the
nurse is directly responsible for the service of food. If any food is
not just as it should be the nurse is expected to telephone to the kitchen
and report it, and it is immediately corrected. The nurse also
knows just what is appetizing to certain patients and may request certain
foods for them. One big problem is the patient who has been in
the hospital for a long time and needs special attention, and it is
these patients that the dietitians try the hardest to please. The menus
are sent daily to the ward, and the nurse makes out her diet request
list. She stated also that for the regular diets 1 pt. of milk and 1 egg
are allowed per day; for light diets 1 qt. of milk and 1 egg; for soft
diets 1½-qt. milk and 2 eggs; and for liquid diets 1½ qt. milk and 4–6
eggs.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>CAPT. EARL P. GREEN, Mess Officer at Walter Reed: Stated he had been three
years at the Walter Reed and that during that time many problems have
come up. He stated that food and service are the two principle things
about feeding people, but the greatest difficulty is service. It is very
important to get the people serving the food confident that it is all
right. He said a nurse could take the best food to a patient and if she
thought it was not good the patient would not eat it. Good food can be
bought with money, but service cannot. He said he used to get his complaints
from the Post and Star, but this has been eliminated by requiring
the nurse to report anything which she thinks is wrong in the diet, and
that no complaint is too small to investigate. He believed the mess department
could hide nothing, but should be fair and above board.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: “Recently the White House and my office have been bombarded
with what seems to us to be a propaganda against the reduction of the
ration cost in one of the hospitals of the Public Health Service. This
brings to my mind two thoughts: first, in the matter of administration
of the affairs of your hospital be sure that you do not take too many
people into your confidence in considering any changes you have in mind
to make. The fewer people that do the talking and the more that do the
acting the better you are off. Also, I would like to express the
feelings of Mrs. Harding, who has given a great deal of attention to the
matter of the world war veteran and the matter of his feeding. This is
what we would like these veterans to have—a generous diet of wholesome
food, well-prepared and neatly served.”</p>

<p class='c018'>MR. L. C. SPANGLER, Associate Medical Purveyor of the public Health Service
presented the subject “Hospital Supplies”, reading as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The term Hospital Supplies may be construed in its broadest sense
to mean everything used in a hospital. A fully equipped modern hospital
in its various departments will use approximately 5000 different articles.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the selection, purchase, inspection, storage, and distribution of
such a wide variety of supplies in the quantities used by the government
lies an opportunity to effect the saving of large sums. Careless or inefficient
handling of any branch of this work may result in heavy losses.
As it is obviously impracticable to purchase all articles for which individual
officers have a preference it becomes necessary to have a standard
list of supplies. This list is revised from time to time eliminating
such items as can be replaced with more serviceable articles. Through
frequent revisions all new medicines, instruments, etc., of proved worth
find a place on the list.</p>

<p class='c010'>By referring to the standard list requisitioning officers can ascertain
the articles kept in stock at supply depots. Requisitions for
articles not appearing on this list should be reduced to a minimum and
when such requisitions are submitted they should be accompanied by a detailed
explanation as to the necessity for the supplies requested.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>Standard specifications are in course of preparation for all supplies
which are purchased in large quantities. Such specifications enable the
Supply Section to obtain wider competition from manufacturers and insures
the delivery of a uniform and satisfactory product.</p>

<p class='c010'>Commodities purchased in relatively small quantities can be obtained
more advantageously when manufacturers stock articles are specified, as
lower prices will be received and earlier deliveries secured.</p>

<p class='c010'>The careful test and inspection of all supplies purchased either during
their manufacture or after delivery has been made is an important
function of the Supply Section. The inspection of supplies shipped direct
to hospitals by contractors devolves upon the receiving officer who is
furnished with either specifications or samples to enable him to protect
the interests of the government.</p>

<p class='c010'>Satisfactory distribution of hospital supplies is extremely difficult
unless suitable warehouses are available which should be centrally located
at points having good shipping facilities, preferably both rail and water.
To attempt to use buildings for a supply depot which have not been constructed
for that specific purpose delays the work and appreciably increases
the cost of administration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Approximately 25 per cent of the supplies now being issued from Public
Health Service Supply Depots were received from surplus Army stores.
These supplies will be issued on approved requisitions until the stock
is exhausted and no further surplus is obtainable. Every effort should
be made by service officers to use these materials and avoid the purchase
of supplies as far as possible, as with few exceptions such supplies are
in good condition. Such items as rubber goods, suture materials and others
of a perishable nature received from Army surplus are occasionally found
defective due to the fact that they were purchased several years ago.
Attempts have persistently been made to eliminate such deteriorated articles
from stock by examination at the Supply Depots before shipment is
made. This process has been successful in preventing the issuance of
inferior goods except in a few instances in which the material forwarded
was in original unbroken packages.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the interest of economy substitutions of articles received from
Army surplus will continue to be made for special items requisitioned for
unless some compelling reason requires a purchase be made. The necessity
for the continuance of this practice will be understood when it is considered
that sufficient funds have not always been available to lay in
stocks of standard supplies to permit us to intelligently anticipate and
arrange for our future requirements, or even at times, such as during the
last quarter, to enable us to make purchases for actual and urgent needs
of the Service, a condition of very serious concern to the efficiency and
proper functioning of the work of purchase and supply.</p>

<p class='c010'>The proper care and economical use of hospital supplies should be
insisted upon by officers in charge of hospitals and the officer who permits
loss through excessive breakage, negligence of theft fails in the
performance of one of his most important duties. To delegate this duty
to a subordinate and fail to require its strict enforcement does not
relieve the officer in charge of his responsibility.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>It may be interesting to you to know the procedure through which
a requisition passes after being dispatched by a station.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as it is received in the Purveying Service it is numbered,
record is made of it and notice of receipt forwarded to the station where
it originated with the statement that the receipted requisition bears a
certain number to which reference should be made if inquiry is later necessary
concerning items appearing thereon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second step is to the approving officer. Here it is carefully
scanned, its contents noted and it is found to include articles of a
non-standard or unusual character the requisition is forwarded to that
section of the Marine Hospital Division interested in supplies of the class
involved, such as Laboratory and X-ray, Physiotherapy, etc., for recommendation
as to furnishing, after which it is returned to the approving officer
who approves it without change or with amendments deleting certain
items entirely or reducing the quantities requisitioned, in each case
notifying the station whence the requisition emanated of action taken. In
some instances he may request, as you are fully aware, further information
relative to the necessity for certain materials.</p>

<p class='c010'>After approval the requisition is returned to the Purveying Service.
If the supplies desired are in stock, the Supply Depots are instructed to
forward them to the station. Information of this action is sent them at
the same time by mailing a carbon copy of shipping order. If not in stock,
but covered by the General Schedule of Supplies, articles are purchased
under the contracts contained in that schedule.</p>

<p class='c010'>Circular proposals are then prepared for the remaining items which
are not carried in stock at the Supply Depots or for whose supply contract
has not been placed by the General Supply Committee. Bids are requested
from as many firms as are able to supply articles and after a period of
from 5 to 10 days award is made to the contractor agreeing to furnish the
most suitable article at the lowest price.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before, however, any article can be purchased, unless specifically
exempted, inquiry must be made through the Office of the Chief Coordinator,
General Supply, as to whether or not the articles desired by the station
can be secured from the surplus stocks of any Government Department. Action
is this regard is taken prior to issuance of the circular proposal.
If the Chief Coordinator states that it is possible to secure the supplies
from surplus of a particular department, we must then communicate with the
department mentioned to inquire if the articles desired are at that time
available. A statement regarding their condition, price and location is
also requested. Upon receipt of this information order is placed with
the particular department.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the procuring of certain items of which there is no supply in
stock or which are not usually stocked, authority is given the station to
obtain proposals locally either because the quantity is insignificant,
the value small, not justifying the cost of transportation, or because the
station can more advantageously obtain the particular item requisitioned.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>Of course this routine regarding requisitions does not apply to emergency
requests. They are always cleared without delay and every effort
made to furnish the supplies called for as expeditiously as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not a part of the functions of the Purveying Service to approve
or disapprove requisitions for hospital supplies. This duty is performed
by an officer who represents the Marine Hospital Division and who works
in the office of the Medical Purveyor that the prompt handling of requisitions
may not be delayed. It is greatly in your favor if you have in the
eyes of the approving officer a reputation for practicing economy in the
use of supplies. Many of you have not met this approving officer, but
you are all old friends of his. He has made you acquaintance through
handling the requisitions prepared under your direction and he has formed
a very accurate idea of your ability to foresee your needs. He knows whether
your requisitions are closely scrutinised before you approve them, or
whether your chief aim in life is to have the contents of the Supply
Depot shipped to your station before the other fellow gets it.”</p>

<p class='c018'>LIEUT. JOEL T. BOONE, U. S. NAVY: presented the next subject—“The Social
Service Worker”, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Chairman, members of the Federal Board of Hospitalization, and
fellow guests—</p>

<p class='c010'>The subject given to me to present is worthy of more expert and more
specialized elucidation than I an able to furnish with  meager knowledge
of the functions of the Social Service Worker. We are interested to
know just what position the Social Service Worker should advantageously
occupy in our sincere efforts to provide the very best care and the very
best care and the very best treatment for those unfortunate individuals
who have been disabled in the service of our country or who have suffered
disabilities as a result of or traceable to that service during the World
War.</p>

<p class='c010'>My knowledge of the Social Service Worker for the most part is limited
to his or her duties associated with Naval institutions. For almost three
years I have represented at National Headquarters of the American Red
Cross the Surgeon General of the Navy, who is the Navy Department’s representative
on the National Executive Committee. My official position has
been one of liaison but, in the organization of the Rod Cross, I am the
Director of the Bureau of Naval Affairs. In that position it has been my
privilege to assist in the adoption of a Naval-Red Cross program for the
carrying out of one of the purposes of the Red Cross Congressional Charter,
which obligates the Red Cross to act, “in natters of voluntary relief, and
in accord with the military and naval authorities as a medium of communication
between the people of the United States of America and their Army
and Navy.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>In my investigations as to the sphere of the Social Service Worker,
I have found two schools of thought or two groups interpreting the meaning
of the Social Service Worker differently. One group limits the definition
to that personnel which deals with purely personal and community
problems of individuals, and also to those who are trained medical social
service workers; while the second group, sees no limitation to the field
of operation by a highly specialized worker in dealing with an individual’s
welfare. The first group separates the recreational, amusement, entertainment
and athletic directors from the strictly medical social service
workers; while again the second group consider the amusement personnel
as properly placed under the category of social service workers.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are not particularly interested here in this academic discussion
but we should be mindful of it in giving consideration to the organization
and administration of our hospitals. There is a limit to all things so
the social service worker is limited in his or her field of activity. We
seem to be living in an age of specialization. We need sanity in the
practice of our professions irrespective of their nature; and what is
just as essential, we need good practical common horse sense and not too
much theory.</p>

<p class='c010'>I believe the Commanding Officer can be rated a skilled social
service worker more competent to deal with the problems of his patient
than any other individual, if he is a keen observer of human nature, if he
has the interest of the patient at heart, if he searches for, what we call,
the soul of the man and not merely observe his flesh and blood, if he is
determined to correct the mental restlessness as well as the physical
agony, if he considers his patient individually and not as a case, and if
he impresses on his patient that no one is as much interested in him as
his Commanding Officer. No one in an institution should be able to take
the Commanding Officer’s place in the sympathetic understanding of the
patient. Of those in the military and naval service it has been said, that
the uniform stands like a closed door between officer and patient. There
should be no reason for this. If it exists, the officer is responsible.</p>

<p class='c010'>You will appreciate why I make the foregoing remarks. The Commanding
Officer cannot perform all the duties incident to the operation of a hospital
and the care and treatment of a large number of patients, but,
while he must have various types of personnel to care for the patient, he
cannot delegate his responsibility for the patient’s welfare.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the organization of our hospitals there is a proper place for
social service the detail operation of which must be left to personnel
which devotes its entire time to matters of a social nature, and to matters
touching the personal, family and community problems of the patient.
Obviously it would be most desirable to have all classes of personnel
working in our governmental hospitals to be paid governmental employees.
We are working toward the millennium but we are far distant from it,
hence, we must avail ourselves of what we find at hand. The United States
is populated with a kindly, sympathetic and generous people, which fact
makes it possible for the unfortunate hospitalized to enjoy the generosity
of our citizenry, much of our social programs in hospitals is made
possible by the great membership and charitable organizations of our
country. Through these organizations the American people can and do desire
to assist constituted governmental authorities to provide for the welfare
of the war disabled as well as the regular service man. As I have
stated in the first part of my remarks, the Congress has legalized the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>assistance the American Red Cross can render the Army and Navy. When the
veteran is hospitalized in Naval institutions he is given every consideration
and treated as a naval patient. We cannot and have no desire to make
any distinction between him who is serving his country today, and him who
went to its defense yesterday. The truly patriotic would not have it otherwise.
The service man of today has been actuated by just as high patriotic
motives to serve his flag as the man who stood willing to sacrifice his all
in the days when our beloved land was outwardly threatened by a visible
enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>To those of us who are intensely interested in every phase of the
veteran problem and who do not look upon the veteran as merely a medical
or surgical case, the testimony given and the tribute paid to welfare
endeavors and all forms of social service by Doctor White yesterday morning,
was most gratifying. Those of us of the medical profession have the
highest regard for the keen insight of a patient’s mental condition,
possessed by Doctor White.</p>

<p class='c010'>Social service should have a definite place in hospital organization.
Social service should be the agent of the Commanding Officer for dealing
with; (a) the relationships of the hospital to other groups in the community;
(b) the relation of the patients to their families and their
community; and (c) in the relation of those matters which affect the social
conditions which are involved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course everything in the Social Service Department as in any other
department of the hospital must be under the absolute control of the Commanding
Officer. It has a relation to the administration of the hospital,
and to the patients’ treatment. In its relation to the hospital the
Social Service Department may:</p>

  <dl class='dl_7'>
    <dt>(a)</dt>
    <dd>Provide entertainment.
    </dd>
    <dt>(b)</dt>
    <dd>Regulate visiting under the Commanding Officer’s direction.
    </dd>
    <dt>(c)</dt>
    <dd>Receive proper donations previously authorized by the Commanding Officer.
    </dd>
    <dt>(d)</dt>
    <dd>Stimulate in the adjacent community resources which can be beneficial to the patients.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c010'>In the Navy the funds for our entertainment program are primarily
provided from allotment made by the Morale Division of the Navy Department
and from ships shore or canteen profits. The Red Cross supplements our
endeavors and assigns at certain hospitals other personnel than Home
Service or Social Service Workers, to assist in recreational measures.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Social Service Department’s relation to the patient’s treatment:</p>

  <dl class='dl_7'>
    <dt>(a)</dt>
    <dd>Securing social histories and other significant data for use of tuberculosis specialists
    and psychiatrists.

<p class='c010'>Then there is the After Care of the patient and one the Social
Service Department should be competent to handle:</p>

  <dl class='dl_7'>
    <dt>(a)</dt>
    <dd>Helping to connect men approved for vocational training to get in contact with the proper

    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c010'>Lastly there is the Information service which this Department
may provide:</p>

  <dl class='dl_7'>
    <dt>(a)</dt>
    <dd>Communicating with family doctors and others to assist in securing affidavits necessary
    to substantiate government claims.

    </dd>
    <dt>(d)</dt>
    <dd>Furnishing information regarding government insurance.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c010'>The Social Service Department of the hospital irrespective of the
source of supply of the personnel must be considered as an integral part
of the hospital, subject to the inspections, rules and regulations of the
hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Red Cross at present provides the personnel for social service
endeavors and I cannot conceive how any other agency could undertake to
provide this service without providing the cobweb like organization spread
out over the United States with thousands of Home Service sections as the
Red Cross maintains, prepared to furnish information to the government
officials. Until the government can provide a similar, and an adequate
service, I know of no other civilian organization which enjoys the semi-official
recognition imposed by the Congress and to which we in the government
can turn for assistance, than the American Red Cross.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>The social service problem is one of helping the doctor, the man,
the family, and to represent the community.</p>

<p class='c010'>We as medical men must remember that treatment, if successfully instituted,
must embrace rehabilitation of the mind to a like degree that
it does the body. A cure cannot be affected by the simple administration
of drugs or a stroke of the scalpel. Something just as important, and in
many instances more so, is the attention to the mental state of the
patient. All the medicine, all the most skilled surgery will not cure
unless careful attention is paid to the mental frame of mind of the patient.
The whole social service effort is one to help bring back the
patient to the world of reality and to maintain morale at a high level.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must always be conscious that in caring for patients there is a
basic distinction due to the mental depressions resultant from illness,
helplessness and dependency, and protracted convalescence. Sick men have
distorted judgment, reason illogically, magnify trifles, and acquire a
certain degree of negativeness. Their spirit of discipline is stunted.
They resent correction and restriction. They must be retrained to think
logically and coherently. Each patient must be treated separately, prescribing
for his individualism when he is abed and while still unable to
attempt a return to group action. The morale of the patient is just as
important as the administration of drugs or surgical relief. In fact, I
do not believe it too broad a statement to say more so, for every patient
must be treated from a morale standpoint. While some patients need medical,
others surgical treatment, a great many need neither medical nor surgical
attention, but only mental rehabilitation. The last class are not necessarily
pathological cases nor psychiatric cases, but a peculiar class demanding
careful study and definite prescription usually of a <span class='under'>recreational</span>
form.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must not overdo the social service for the good of the man himself,
his family and his community. The greatest service we can render
the disabled ex-service man is to reinstall in him self-reliance. We must
keep his morale high, for morale is the perpetual ability to come back.”</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. EDWIN P. WOLFE gave the following discussion on “Hospital Supplies”.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Spangler has given us a very complete description of the general
method of procurement, storage and issue of supplies required in the
management of hospitals. It may be permissible, however, to elaborate a
few of the details and to call attention to certain common errors on the
part of hospital personnel using these supplies.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a well established principle for the efficient distribution of
supplies that the final “break-up” be made as near the ultimate destination
of the supplies as is practicable. This requires, of course, a sufficient
number of supply depots located in suitable sections of the
country from which the individual hospitals can secure their supplies with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>the least practicable delay. The question of size and location as well as
rental cost of warehouses is ofttimes the determining factor in the number
of depots from which supplies are to be distributed. From the standpoint
of economy in operation, fewer depots of larger size are the more desirable;
from the standpoint of prompt distribution, the larger number, more
widely distributed are the more desirable. It requires a great deal of
study of transportation lines and traffic conditions to decide upon the
happy mean between these two.</p>

<p class='c010'>The average person who uses hospital supplies has very little conception
of the great amount of storage space which is necessary in order
to carry at all times in the warehouses a six months’ stock to the end
that requisitions may be filled immediately upon receipt. As an illustration,
the Medical Department of the Army had in operation within the
territorial limits of the United States on November 1, 1918, ten large
distributing depots, with an aggregate floor space of more than
2,000,000 square feet. This area expressed in square feet is so staggering
as to convey a very inadequate conception of its size. To those of you
who are familiar with the methods of describing land in the central and
western states, it may be made intelligible by saying that the area
exceeds that of a forty acre tract. In fact, it is approximately 45
acres. If you can conceive of such a tract piled ten feet high with
supplies, allowing, of course, for roadways and aisles you will get some
conception of the mass of material which had been accumulated for the
Army at that date. Then bear in mind that there were thirty-three camps,
each with its large general hospital, having three warehouses, approximately
25 × 125 feet more or less completely filled with supplies and you
can get an idea of the quantity of supplies required for current use in
those hospitals and for dispensary service of the camp. As a further
illustration of the quantities of supplies necessary it may be permissible
to state that the quantity of gauze of various meshes, from that required
in bandages down to the coarsest grade used in surgical dressings,
not forgetting, of course, the muslin, that was procured by use between
April 6, 1917 and March, 1918, was sufficient to have provided a strip
a yard wide around the earth at the equator and a bow knot consisting of
several hundred miles in addition. If the yarn which was required in
weaving this mass of material had been all made into one single thread,
one end of it might have been hooked on the limb of some giant tree on
earth with the other end dropped into one of the spots on the sun and
still had a few thousand miles to spare. The number of beds actually
available for use in the hospitals in the United States on January 1,
1919, if placed end to end would have stretched over a distance in excess
of 90 miles. If the mattresses had been placed side by side and end to
end to form a square, they would have covered sixteen acres.</p>

<p class='c010'>Proper warehousing is a very necessary part of the supply service.
For efficient warehousing as well as for prompt and satisfactory distribution
of supplies, a standard list of articles to be used is necessary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>These articles should be grouped in the warehouse in conformity with the
class to which they belong,—textiles in one place; drugs, medicines and
reagents in another; hospital furniture in another, and so on through
the entire list of supplies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Warehouses should be located on railroad spurs so that supplies may
be delivered directly from cars into the warehouse and from the warehouse
directly into the cars. Concentration of storage space is desirable on
account of the shorter distance to move supplies when unloading and loading.
To this end a depot consisting of several stories, one above another,
affords the minimum trackage necessary in handling supplies and it is desirable
that such a building be selected when practicable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The decision in the early part of the year 1917 to restrict the
number of articles, particularly surgical instruments, which would be
manufactured for the use of the hospital services of the Government and
for civilian use made it possible to provide the essentials for hospital
services with the limited manufacturing facilities which were then available.
Such a list had been in use in the Medical Department of the Army
for many years and doubtless similar lists obtained in the hospital services
of other departments of the Government. This standard list presupposes
specifications for the articles enumerated therein; specifications
again presuppose personnel qualified to determine what those
specifications should be. To write concise and adequate specifications
requires familiarity on the part of the personnel writing them with the
articles described therein and not only with the articles themselves, but
with the process of their manufacture. The prime essential of the efficient
supply service therefore is not limited to the funds provided by
Congress but embraces as of equal importance a personnel trained in the
actual purchase, inspection, storage and issue of the supplies, secured
at the cost of the appropriations which have generally been so liberally
made by Congress. The actual buying of an article and the placing of the
contract therefore, is a comparatively simple matter, but the question of
determining whether the articles purchased will satisfactorily accomplish
the object for which they were procured is an acquirement which comes only
with years of observation and experience, and then in those persons whose
inclinations the more readily adapt them to the routine necessary to
acquire this experience. Whatever may be the standard of any article
which may be selected, the assurance that the article delivered conforms
to the article specified rests solely upon the qualifications of the
person designated to inspect and accept it.</p>

<p class='c010'>From years of experience in presenting the needs of the hospital
service of the Army to Congress, I am convinced of the urgent necessity
for economy along all lines of expenditure and activities. Economy does
not necessarily mean the elimination of activities nor the discontinuance
of the use of various articles in order to bring the gross expenditure
within the sums appropriated. It does mean, however, that no greater
quantity of any article, however insignificant, which may be issued to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>the user, shall be used for that purpose than is actually necessary to
accomplish the results desired. It means that the services of employees
shall be fully and efficiently used. It means that the articles which
are not consumable in character shall be handled with such care and regard
to their future usefulness as will continue them in efficient service for
the greatest length of time. As an illustration, it is common practice
among many physicians when writing prescriptions for various ailments to
prescribe a four ounce mixture and to dismiss the patient. The same practice
has obtained very largely in the hospital services of the Government.
If, instead of issuing the usual four ounce mixture a two ounce, or a
one ounce mixture had been prescribed, equally good results would have been
obtained, since the patient in many instances actually takes only a quarter,
a third or a half of the four ounce mixture, recovers from the ailment
for which it was prescribed and throws the medicine away. This is
particularly true in military practice. If the lesser quantity be prescribed
and further medication be found necessary, the patient for whom it
is prescribed will return to the doctor, giving him an opportunity for another
and more complete physical examination and consideration of the remedy,
of the result obtained and of any other more suitable, or have the prescription
refilled if it be necessary. A dozen tablets should be dispensed
in place of customary two or three dozen. In other words, in the hospitals
and dispensary services of the Government the medicines issued should be in
quantities not to exceed the retirements of three days. This will result
not only in the saving of drugs themselves, as well as of bandages and
surgical dressings issued, but will result in material saving in the cost
of the containers in which they are issued. We too infrequently consider
the sum which the aggregate saving of the few cents here and the few cents
there will reach at the end of a year in the larger hospital services.
With supplies abundant and seemingly easy to secure everyone who uses
them is prone to become prodigal in their use and I cannot emphasize too
strongly the need for economy along these lines. The application of the
old saying, “take care of the pennies and the dollars will take care of
themselves” to the every day use of supplies in hospitals would result in
enormous savings at the end of the year.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was very much impressed with the remarks of Dr. Lavinder on specialization
of medical practice and the tendency in governmental institutions
to carry it to extremes. This is no where more pronounced than in the
demand for hospital supplies. What our patients need is plenty of attention
and simplicity in equipment and treatment. Efficiency, yes, but simplicity
especially. How often it happens that a medical officer at a governmental
institution becomes imbued with the idea that he requires certain
special apparatus which must be obtained at considerable cost to the procuring
agents to carry out his theories of treatment. In a few months, or
a couple of years at the longest, he is relieved from those duties, at that
hospital and goes elsewhere. The officer who follows him conceives that
an entirely different set of instruments and equipment is necessary for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>treatment of the same class of patients than those used by the former
medical officer. The instruments and equipment of the former officer are
returned to the store rooms where they take up valuable space and new
equipment is secured by the incoming officer to take their place.</p>

<p class='c010'>The elimination of these personal peculiarities and requirements will
do much to reduce the enormous expenditure which is everywhere being made
for hospital supplies and equipment.</p>

<p class='c010'>In closing, permit me again to stress the need for economy in the
use of all supplies required by governmental hospitals, for an earnest
effort to use the equipment provided to its utmost efficiency and an honest
effort to get the most out of all the expendable supplies used in the
treatment of the patients committed to our care. If we are honest in
these efforts we will have no difficulty in convincing both Houses of
Congress of the justness of our requests for funds to carry out the
purpose committed to us.”</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL JAMES A. MATTISON, Chief, Surgeon, N.H.D.V.S.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of the various papers which have been read this afternoon on the
medical side, nursing side, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diet and supplies, the two
words which seem to have been the key-note of each of these papers have
been ‘standardization’ and ‘cooperation’. It seems to me that the matter
of standardization on the subject that I am to talk on is one of the
most important factors that we can consider.” He stated that standardization
could be carried not only through the individual hospital, but
through every government agency which does this type of work. He continued,
reading the following article—“Hospital Supplies”.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Almost every group of hospitals follows a different system in the
business management, especially from the standpoint of procuring, conserving,
and issuing of supplies. It is believed that a decided step
forward for U. S. Veterans’ Hospitals would be a standardization in the
method of procuring, handling, and issuing of all supplies. At the present
time most of our agencies have different laws regulating the methods by
which supplies are to be purchased and handled.</p>

<p class='c010'>In some branches of the service practically everything has to be
procured on competitive bids. In some, greater leeway is allowed and
certain articles may be purchased by circular letter, while others give
still greater leeway in allowing the purchase of a large quantity of
supplies in open market. There are advantages in all of these methods and
at the same time there are opportunities, at least in some cases of some
of the methods being greatly abused. This, however, depends almost wholly
upon the personnel responsible for the transactions.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>The property officer or employee, whether he is represented by the
same person as the purchasing officer or not, is inseparably connected with
the subject of supplies, and the weaknesses connected with hospital supplies,
provided such an officer is not too greatly handicapped, depends to
a very large extent upon this individual.</p>

<p class='c010'>The per capita cost of supplies in general is dependent not so much
upon the quantity actually used as upon the waste which takes place, and
the waste depends wholly upon the personnel handling the supplies. It is
therefore, highly important that the personnel in charge of the supplies
must of necessity be thoroughly trained and conversant with the needs and
requirements of the service and at the same time have authority to question
requisitions and demands which are in excess of apparent needs. This is a
fact which I am sure we all recognize.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not the policy of the Government in any branches of the service
to furnish inferior quality of supplies. However, the experience of Government
hospitals in general is, that it is quite difficult in many cases to
get the grade of goods delivered that is specified, regardless of what
method is followed in making purchases. This is particularly true with
certain firms who regard U. S. Government agencies as legitimate prey and
have no scruples in unloading undesirable goods or goods of an inferior
quality, provided they are able to get away with it. I daresay that every
branch of the service has to contend with this condition and it is believed
that here again there should be some means by which other branches of the
service may be apprised of information regarding unreliable firms which has
been obtained by them through actual experience.”</p>

<p class='c018'>MR. M. SANGER, of St. Elizabeths’ Hospital, gave a further discussion of
“Hospital Supplies”, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Spangler, in a presentation of the question of Hospital Supplies,
has covered in a general way the method of deciding the class of supplies
required, how to procure these supplies, how to decide upon the quantities
needed, and the general scope of standardizing supplies so as to serve
the best interests of the Government, to supply the needs of the patients,
and to procure and conserve the supplies in the most economic and efficient.
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>In reference to the supplies themselves, as has been stated, the
first thing is to decide what is needed. The second, as to the best method
by which these supplies may be purchased. Third, the amount of warehouse
space available for storing these supplies. Fourth, as to the best grade
of supplies to secure for the particular purpose for which they may be required.
Fifth, considering warehouse space and the non-perishable class
of supplies, what are the most economic quantities in which they may be purchased.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>There are one or two matters pertaining to the question of supplies,
however, that it seems he has not touched upon, and which I will discuss
for a few minutes. The first is in relation to those which may be considered
the non-expendibles, or more specifically those supplies which are
necessary in connection with machines of various classes; whether it be
automobiles, refrigerating machines, boilers, large tools, or what not. As
soon as a machine of this sort is secured, an entry should be made showing
date of order, date of receipt, cost, name of make, from whom purchased,
and any other information of a similar nature. This information will be
needed in order to purchase repair parts, and when needed, as in case of
a breakdown, it will be needed in a hurry. Parts may have to be purchased
by telegraph. The same information would be needed in case of inventory,
or, if a cost system were in effect, to show depreciation, wear and tear,
or give other information in order to secure accurate cost figures.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second item which I would speak of is the manner or method in
which you keep record of your general supplies. To a great extent, your
success or failure will depend upon the extent to which you are able to
keep up a continuity of certain supplies. For illustration, in running a
power plant one must at all times have an ample supply of fuels, oils,
packings, and repair parts. If you are furnishing food, you must at all
times have an ample supply of certain articles of diet. Your dietitian
prepares your menu and lists certain articles. These articles are required
for certain periods. Failure to have these items of supplies when required
upsets the menus. Substitutes must be utilized, which ofttimes bring
duplication of items on succeeding days or meals. This will often lead to
complaints on the part of the patient or student, who desires a change and
who believes his rights are being interfered with.</p>

<p class='c010'>I would suggest, in order to minimize such occurrences, that a form of
perpetual inventory be installed, with labels in the form of cards or records
attached to each item. On such records, there should be marked the
minimum mount of each item that should be carried before a new requisition
is to be placed for replenishing the supply on hand. The amount of the
minimum of each item will have to be decided upon data based upon experience
covering, (first) quantities used, and (second) time required for a
new supply to be received after the order has been placed, (third) whether
supplies are to be obtained direct from the contractor or if purchase must
be made on the open market, whether supplies come from the vicinity of the
place where required or must be shipped from a distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>These things, though they seem small in themselves, as your experience
will doubtless demonstrate, are of such importance that I cannot place too
much weight upon them; and I think that a very early and close study of
these questions will assist you to a material extent in meeting the problems
that will confront you, and enable you to overcome many of your difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>MISS RUTH EMERSON, of the American Red Cross, taking Mr. Pearson’s place on
the program, stated that it was because the Surgeon General of the Public
Health Service turned to the Red Cross that they came into being in this
particular connection.</p>

<p class='c010'>She stated that certain fundamental principles had been written down
between the Public Health Service and the Red Cross, which had been
abided by, and that it had been a great problem which was taken up with
the Commanding Officer to keep out the things that were undesirable and
to bring to each hospital the best things for that hospital, not only
for the patients but for the personnel. She stated further that on the
information side the Red Cross had been a great aid in bringing to the
patients knowledge about various government regulations, but that now as
more and more attempts are made by the various departments to get this
information to the man the need for the Red Cross in this regard becomes
less. Another important function of the social service worker is to find
out the home conditions to which a man with tuberculosis is going when
discharged from the hospital.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. BLACKWOOD: stated that as the hour was late he moved that the
discussion of this important subject be postponed until tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>The motion was carried and the meeting adjourned at 4:45 P.M.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: “I would like to ask if either of our committees are
ready to report or whether they have any inquiries to make”. He
asked Captain Blackwood for a report.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. BLACKWOOD reported that the Committee on Forms met yesterday
noon and felt they had a task that was going to take months. As
they had no copies of the forms in use two of the members of the
committee were to get them by noon today.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: urged that the matter be pushed in order that some little
understanding at least might be had before the end of the meetings,
that perhaps some suggestions could be made that could be carried
out after the meetings adjourned. “I am requested to state for the
Committee on Resolutions that there is no special report that they
have to make now.” He introduced Admiral Stitt, to preside.</p>

<p class='c018'>ADMIRAL STITT: “The first paper is “Discussion of Disciplinary Regulations
of Veterans’ Bureau as they affect the beneficiaries and
hospitals,” which someone will read for Colonel Patterson, who is
still ill.”</p>

<p class='c018'>MAJOR R. W. BLISS, U. S. Veterans’ Bureau, took up “Discussion of
Disciplinary Regulations of Veterans’ Bureau as they affect the
beneficiaries and hospitals”, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a discussion of U. S. Veterans’ Bureau General Orders 27,
dated September 9, 1921 and 27–A dated January 14, 1922, covering the
Disciplinary regulations governing beneficiaries of the Veterans’
Bureau who are patients in hospital, it is assumed that even before
September 1921, all present recognized the advisability and necessity
of some lawful method by which the small lawless element, often present
in hospitals, as it is in any other community might be effectively dealt
with.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is further assumed that the provisions of the September
General Order #27 are generally well known to this audience.</p>

<p class='c010'>Therefore, this present paper will be limited to a brief
statement of fact of the numbers of patients discharged under this
order, and to a statement of the essential differences in the September
G. O. #27 and the G. O. 27–A, issued yesterday, leaving any comment to
the general discussion.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have here a chart showing the name, location and type of
every Government hospital receiving Veterans’ Bureau patients, and giving
the total number of patients in each, and the total number of
patients discharged from each one, under the provisions of General
Order #27, between the dates of the issuance of this order, on
September 9, 1921 and January 14, 1922.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>This represents 67 Public Health Service Hospitals, 14
Naval Hospitals, 9 hospitals connected with the National Homes for
Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, 6 Army hospitals and St. Elizabeths’
Hospital, under the Interior Department, a total of 97 Government
hospitals.</p>

<p class='c010'>The total number of patients, to which I shall refer
hereafter, mean Veterans’ Bureau Patients.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between the dates above mentioned there have been in and
admitted to these 97 hospitals, 44,318 patients. Of this number,
474, or a trifle over 1%, have been discharged for disciplinary
reasons; 732 or 2% have left against Medical Advice, and 1804 or
4% have been absent without leave for a period of 7 days or over,
and have so been dropped from the rolls of the hospital. This is a
total of 3010 or 7%.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the 67 Public Health Service hospitals there have been
33,028 patients, of this number 336, or 1% have been discharged for
disciplinary reasons, 520 or 1.5% have left against Medical Advice,
and 1233 or 3.5% have been dropped as over 7 days A.W.O.L. This is a
total of 2089 or 6%.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the 14 Naval hospitals, there have been 2571 patients.
Of this number, 44, or 1.7% have been discharged for disciplinary
reasons, 49 or 1.5% have left against Medical Advice, and 44 or 1.7%
have been dropped as AWOL. This is a total of 107 or 4%.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the 9 soldiers homes there have been 4721 patients. Of
this number 56 or 1.2% have been discharged for disciplinary reasons,
111 or 2.3% have left against Medical Advice, and 437 or 9.2% have
been dropped as A.W.O.L. This is a total of 604 or 12.7%.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the six Army hospitals, there have been 3076 patients.
Of this number 44 or 1.4% have been discharged for disciplinary
reasons, 50, or 1.6% have been discharged against medical advice, and
65 or 2% have been dropped as AWOL. This is a total of 159 or 5%.</p>

<p class='c010'>St. Elizabeth’s hospital has had 922 patients and our
records show that none have been discharged for disciplinary reasons,
none left against advice and none have been dropped as A.W.O.L.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a general way, the large tubercular hospitals show the
greatest number and percentage of discharges under this order.
One or two hospitals show over 30% discharges, these being mostly
against advice and absent without leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the issuance of the September General Order #27
a great deal of adverse criticism of it has been received from many
sources.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>With this in mind and with the knowledge that penalties
were prescribed in the original order which did not conform exactly

<p class='c010'>Provision is made for minor punishments.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Board of Officers above referred to is to be
composed of two medical officers on the staff of the hospital and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>representative of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau appointed by the

compensation up to a maximum of 75% each month for three months may be
made effective.</p>

<p class='c010'>Provision is made for the proper recording of all patients

whether or not the patient has been previously discharged under this
order Section II of General Order 27–A is as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>Patients discharged for disciplinary reasons will not be
readmitted to the hospital from which discharged. So far, of the
patients discharged for disciplinary reasons, 71 have been readmitted to
hospitals.</p>

<p class='c010'>The principal complaint received from patients discharged
has been that they knew nothing of General Order #27.”</p>

<p class='c018'>ADMIRAL STITT: stated that it had been the rule to have all the papers
read before opening the discussions.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON P. S. RAWLS, U. S. P. H. S. (R): read the next paper, “Relation
of District Managers to Hospitals”, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The District Manager and his District Medical Officer need no introduction
to you. You are all familiar with their responsibilities. They
are the representatives of the Veterans’ Bureau with whom you come in
contact most frequently.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>The office of District Manager was created by the Director, Colonel
Forbes, when he assumed direct control of District organizations. The
District Manager is charged with the responsibility for all phases of
the work of the Veterans’ Bureau in his district. The Director also
appointed a District Medical Officer who, through the District Manager,
is responsible for all phases of medical work of the District—the
examination, treatment, hospitalization, dispensary, convalescent and
follow-up care—in fact the entire physical rehabilitation of patients
of the Veterans’ Bureau. And only recently the additional responsibility
of the determination and rating of disability has been added.</p>

<p class='c010'>The medical organization of the District Office has been developed
primarily for the purpose of establishing claimants of the Veterans’
Bureau as patients entitled to treatment, and the furnishing of proper
treatment, under regulations, orders and instructions issued by the
Central Office. The District Manager and his District Medical Officer
are charged execution of these instructions. They are charged with
hospitalization of patients in your hospitals and during such hospitalization,
they must look to you to assume the burden of responsibility.
In order to prevent misunderstanding and to define the relation of
the Veterans’ Bureau and its District Manager to the Service hospitals
and their Commanding Officers, Field Order #23 was issued which states
in Paragraph #2 and #3 as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>You will note that one of the duties of the District Manager is to
keep you informed of the general aims and policies of the Bureau.
This means contact—close personal contact, if possible, with the
Commanding Officers of the hospital, working together, keeping informed—the
District Manager with the work and problems of the Commanding
Officers informed of instructions through the official channels of the
Service to which he belongs.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the District Manager hospitalizes patients in your hospital,
he must, necessarily, have certain reports, as he is still responsible
to the Director for these patients. The reports of physical examination,
on the proper Bureau forms are obviously essential. Important,
too, is the prompt and accurate report of admission to and discharge
from hospital of patients of this Bureau. Mention has been made of the
multiplicity of reports asked for and the Bureau and its District
Offices are making definite effort to relieve you of this burden. With
the extensive decentralization of the work of the Bureau to the District
Offices and the closer cooperation of those offices with your hospitals
the request for reports made upon you in the past will be reduced. I
feel confident that this result is already evident if comparison is
made with conditions of a year ago. During the recent conference in
Washington of District Managers, District Medical Officers and Vocational
Officers, the question of reduction of reports and forms was urged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>resulting in a careful revision and some elimination which should indirectly
affect you.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most direct method of improving this condition will be placing a
representative of the District Manager in your hospital. He will be able
to act with the authority of the District Manager on many matters now causing
difficulty and delay.</p>

<p class='c010'>I should like to take this opportunity to call your attention to certain
phases of treatment which the Veterans’ Bureau and the District Manager
expect you to give to patients, namely, to disease or disability developing
for which the patient was not admitted to hospital and to conditions
which are not apparently of service origin. In this connection, I would
remind you that the Director is charged with providing treatment to beneficiaries
taking Vocational Training for disease or disability not due to
misconduct, although not related to any service disability. This is embodied
in Regulation #12 recently issued and from which I quote:—</p>

<p class='c010'>The relation between the District Manager and the Commanding Officer
of Service hospitals should be one of mutual cooperation. The success of
the hospitalization program of the Bureau depends on this. The intelligent
and sympathetic support of every Commanding Officer is essential and the
Central Office firmly believes that every District Manager will give you
his unqualified support in your work in hospitalization of patients of the
Veterans’ Bureau. The one thing that I would impress on you above all
others and which will do more than all the instructions that could be issued,
is get together with the District Manager.”</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL H. M. EVANS, of the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau: discussed the subject
“Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy in Hospitals” as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The subjects of Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy constitute what
has been designated as the Section of Physical Reconstruction in hospitals.
Early after the United States entered the War the Surgeon General of the
Army realized that it was necessary to utilize all the agencies that would
aid in the recovery of men disabled in the War. He, therefore, established
a Section in the Hospital Division of Physical Reconstruction, to include
Occupational Therapy, curative work-shop instruction, and Physiotherapy
which includes Electrotherapy, Hydrotherapy, Mechanotherapy, Thermotherapy,
massage, and directed exercise. Col. Frank Billings, of Chicago, was made
Chief of the Section, and the Work was developed until there were 48 hospitals
with more or less perfect equipment in Physiotherapy and Occupational
Therapy, 2000 Occupational Aides and curative work-shop instructors, and
1200 Physiotherapy Aides and Medical Officers. There were as many as 34,000
men engaged in some form of Occupational Therapy in one month, and 20,000
different men treated by Physiotherapy.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>Upon the retirement of Col. Billings I was made Chief of the
Section, and the work continued to develop until 69 per cent. of all
hospital patients were doing some form of work in Occupational Therapy
or Prevocational Training. There were many hospitals that maintained
an average of 5000 Physiotherapy treatments a week for a number of
months. As the men were discharged from Army Hospitals the burden of the
Public Health Hospitals became greater, and many of the individuals
who had been active in the Army work became associated with the Public
Health and established as a part of their hospital program the Section
of Physical Reconstruction, to include Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy.
This work has developed throughout the past year and a half.
It was not thought within the province of the Public Health to develop
Prevocational Training.</p>

<p class='c010'>The speaker, having resigned from the Army, accepted a commission
in the Public Health Service and was detailed to the Federal
Board for Vocational Education as Medical Officer in Vocational Training.
For a year and a half in this capacity he assisted in developing
181 centers, most of which were in connection with hospitals, in
which the Prevocational Training was the major part of the work. Under
this management there were about 800 teachers employed, and about
14,00 men engaged in some form of work. Unfortunately, the necessity of
calling this Prevocational Training, in order to have it come under
the Federal Board law, gave a wrong impression of the work as done in
hospitals. When the Veterans’ Bureau came into existence, it took over
the activities of the Federal Board and the Bureau of War Risk Insurance
and correlated these with the Public Health Service, the Veterans’
Bureau having, under the law, power to do anything that was necessary
in the rehabilitation of the ex-service men.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Centers that had been operated under the Federal Board
were divided, and all those attached to hospitals were put under the
Medical Division and the work was considered as Occupational or Prevocational;
all Centers that were for Section 2 trainees were designated
as Vocational Schools, and on November 17, 1921 a program
for Physical Reconstruction in Veterans’ Bureau Hospitals was approved
by the Director, as outlined in <span class='under'>Exhibit A</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In accordance with this approved plan, which had previously
been approved by the Federal Board of Hospitalization, it became necessary
to have a procedure; as all other personnel in hospitals were
responsible to the Commanding Officer and controlled from the headquarters
in Washington, it was deemed advisable and consistent to have
all Veterans’ Bureau personnel that were detailed to a hospital placed
on Central Office Payroll and directed by Central Office. In accordance
with this, on January 18, 1922, a procedure was approved, to be
issued as a General Order, as shown in <span class='under'>Exhibit B</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This makes it very plain as to the attitude of the Federal
Board of Hospitalization and the attitude of the Director of the Veterans’
Bureau toward Physical Reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>In addition to the agencies described, which are usually a
part of Physical Reconstruction, there have been placed for administrative
purposes the Follow-Up Nurses of the Veterans’ Bureau, which
includes 265 graduate nurses, distributed throughout the various districts,
and acting in the capacity of Follow-Up Nurses under the direction
of the Medical Officers, performing duties in accordance with
regulations as outlined in Field Order #18, <span class='under'>Exhibit C</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the past month the Follow-up Nurses performed the
duties as shown in <span class='under'>Exhibit D</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon the division of the so-called Training Centers, as outlined,
the number of teachers and the number of trainees which were
strictly in hospitals were reduced, so that the Report for December,
1921, shows a summary, as given in <span class='under'>Exhibit E</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The greatest difficulties in the way of proper establishment
of physical reconstruction have been, First, Adequate space for hospitals.
Up to the present time this has been considered an extraneous
service and it has only been possible to secure suitable quarters in a
relatively small number of hospitals; but upon the approval of the
Federal Board of Hospitalization and the Director of the Veterans’
Bureau, it now becomes an integral part of the hospital program, and
little difficulty should be experienced in the future. Second, It
has also been difficult to secure proper personnel, particularly for
Occupational Therapy for mental cases, and in order to have this work
efficiently done it is my opinion that school of training should be
established at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, whereby a sufficient number
of Occupational Aides, who have had experience with other types of
patients, may have the opportunity to receive special training in
handling mental cases. When you remember that in the Army there were
only 48 special officers in Physiotherapy and that we now have 100
hospitals, and most of these would need a special officer for this
work and are contemplating establishing a number of clinics in each
district, it is absolutely necessary to make some provision for training
medical officers in Physiotherapy.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have had authority for some months to employ 100 Physiotherapy
Aides and have utilized every aide that has been made available
by Civil service, and have but 7. If we are to meet the requirements
in Physiotherapy it will be necessary to establish a training
center for Physiotherapy Aides, and it is suggested that the facilities
for this work at Walter Reed Hospital and the various Bureau
Clinics, and the Hydrotherapy department at St. Elizabeth’s be
utilized for the training, and that a regular program be utilized
and course of study provided to meet the requirements of this service.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>Another one of the difficulties that is not only applicable
to hospitals, but to all centers of Vocational Training, is the
method of disposing of fabricated articles. The amount of paper work
necessary incident to this and the fact that the money does not revert
to the service but to the general treasury makes it a very unsatisfactory
and cumbersome procedure, and some legislative should be asked
for to enable the Veterans’ Bureau to proceed as the Indian Service
proceeds in disposing of fabricated articles, or articles that are the
result of the work of the trainees. Under the new procedure all personnel
of the veterans’ Bureau detailed to a hospital are directly
under the Medical Officer in Charge. The special work is directed
by the Educational Director, who should be considered as one of the
staff of the hospital. The greatest criticism that has been partially
sustained in regard to Occupational Therapy has been that men
who are physically able to do more purposeful things have been kept
making trivial things, First, because it was relatively easy to amuse
them, Second, Because of some of the articles the patient has derived
considerable revenue from the sale thereof. The whole scheme should
have in mind, First, The Therapeutic value of the activity, Second, The
Prevocational Training of the activity, with the hope that you could
shorten the time of hospitalisation and also shorten the time of Vocational
Training by the amount of Prevocational work done in a hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>Prior to the work in Army Hospitals much individual work had
been in Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, but this was not correlated.
One man emphasized the static machine, another man built up
his institution upon the basis of Hydrotherapy, another upon the physical
exercise, but it remains for the work in the Army Hospitals to
coordinate these agencies and present a solid front for Physiotherapy.
One of the things that remains yet to be accomplished is a proper coordination
between Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy. It is waste
of energy and money to have a Physiotherapy Aide spending hours of time
in massaging a stiffened joint when, if her work could be supplemented
by properly directed physical exercise in a shop or upon the farm, the
same member could be so used as to assist in restoration quite as readily
as from massage. It is expressly understood that all the work in Occupational
Therapy should be upon prescription of the Medical Officer in
Charge of the Hospital or his designated agent, and a proper cooperation
between the Medical staff and the staff of the Reconstruction Section
will insure most satisfactory results, and that this cooperation of the
work will be very necessary in order to secure proper efficiency.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the General Order referred to the ratio of teachers to
patients per teacher must be considered as a general guide only, as it
is quite well known that in mental hospitals the number of men that
can be cared for by a single aide or teacher will be less than in other
hospitals, and it must also be understood that the character of treatment
in Physiotherapy will also modify the number of treatments that
may be given by each individual.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>I am particularly grateful for this opportunity to present
the matter of Physical Reconstruction to the men who are caring for the
disabled veterans, and who can do so much to make this phase of the
hospital program a success.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>1.  Modern hospital treatment requires that Physical Reconstruction
be established as a part of the hospital program.
It is our duty under the Sweet Bill to render this service
to the beneficiaries of the Bureau while in hospitals
and in dispensaries. Such service includes.</p>

<p class='c028'>(a) Occupational therapy and
Pre-Vocational Training.</p>

<p class='c028'>(b) Physiotherapy, which comprehends
directed physical exercise,
Mechanotherapy, Massage, Electrotherapy,
Hydrotherapy, etc.</p>

<p class='c028'>(c) Follow-Up Nursing.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND PRE-VOCATIONAL TRAINING</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>In order to carry out the work in hospitals
of Occupational Therapy and pre-vocational training
it is necessary to have</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c034'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(a) Personnel.</div>
      <div class='line'>(b) Equipment.</div>
      <div class='line'>(c) Expendable material.</div>
      <div class='line'>(d) Suitable space for work.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>(a) It is estimated that it will require 50
additional trade and industrial teachers, 50
additional commercial or academic teachers,
and 100 occupational aides, making a total
of 200, salaries ranging from $1600 to $2400.</p>

<p class='c035'>(b) As the new hospitals opened will be receiving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>men from smaller hospitals, the equipment
that has been used in the small hospitals
may be transferred to the larger ones. It is not
possible to make an accurate estimate as to what
additional material may be needed, as we do not
know how much of this can be secured from other
branches of the Government, but in hospitals
numbering less than 200 patients the amount to be
expended for equipment would be relatively small.
In the new hospitals, however, numbering over 200
patients, where pre-vocational training is desired,
a reasonable equipment would have to be furnished.</p>

<p class='c035'>(c) As to expendable materials for Occupational
Therapy the past experience has shown that it will
amount to $2.00 per month per man actually at work,
and possibly 25 per cent of the entire hospital
population will be doing some work of this character.</p>

<p class='c035'>I would recommend the approval of the plan in
operation in the Public Health Hospitals for disposing
of salable materials made in Occupational Therapy or
trade work, which is that the  patient may make two
articles, giving one to the Government to be sold,
and the other retained by himself. The price for
which the articles to be sold should be established
by a Board of Appraisal, appointed by the Medical
Officer in Charge, or Superintendent, the proceeds
to be used as a revolving fund for purchasing supplies
for this work, if it is legal—if not, the proceeds
to revert to the Treasury of the United States.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>PHYSIOTHERAPY</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>The personnel for this work has been previously
authorized to the extent of 100 physiotherapy aides
and 10 Medical Officers in Physiotherapy. It will
be necessary, of course, to have suitable equipment.
This will be recommended by the District Managers
and approved by the Medical Division before a requisition
is filled.</p>

<p class='c035'>There is a small expense for expendable material
in Physiotherapy, which will not amount to more than
50¢ per month per man for treatments.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>FOLLOW-UP NURSING</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>The plan for Follow-Up Nursing has been approved
and 300 nurses have been authorized. These are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>practically all assigned, and we are requesting
authority for an additional 50 as they may be needed.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>NATIONAL SOLDIERS’ HOMES</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>It is the desire of the Board of Governors of
the National Soldiers’ Homes that the personnel and
equipment for the reconstruction work, including
Occupational Therapy, pre-vocational training, and
Physio-Therapy, be furnished by this Bureau.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>NAVY</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>It is desired that the personnel, equipment,
and material for reconstruction service, covering
all phases of the work, be furnished to the Naval
Hospitals and detailed there to work under the
direction of the Medical Officer in command.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>ARMY</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>It is the desire of the Army Hospitals serving
the Veterans’ Bureau patients that they be permitted
to operate the entire reconstruction program for
these men, and to submit monthly statements prorating
to the Bureau its proportional part of the
expense incurred in serving the patients, the
entire personnel, supplies, and equipment for these
hospitals to be furnished by the Army, and compensated
on the pro rata basis.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>CONTRACT HOSPITALS STATE AND COUNTY INSTITUTIONS</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>The Bureau has been furnishing all personnel
and equipment for the work in these hospitals, and
this work should be established in the hospitals
where there are 50 or more War Risk patients, and
continued in the smaller hospitals where it is now
established until the number available for this work
is reduced to 20. In all contract hospitals where
contracts are to be made in the future suitable
supplies should be required of the hospital for this
work as a part of the minimum standard for hospital
requirements.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>PUBLIC HEALTH HOSPITALS</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>Formerly the Public Health Service furnished
all personnel and equipment utilized in Physiotherapy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>The personnel utilized in Occupational Therapy was
also furnished by the Public Health Service but the
workers engaged in Pre-Vocational Training were
furnished by the Federal Board.</p>

<p class='c035'>In view of the consolidation of all three
agencies for the care of the World War Veterans in the
U. S. Veterans’ Bureau, the following relation is
recommended between the Public Health Service and
the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau. Physiotherapy Aides,
and Reconstruction Aides used in Occupational
Therapy, will be furnished by the Public Health
Service and will be paid by them from appropriations
made from time to time by this Bureau. The workers
and teachers utilized in Pre-Vocational Training in
Public Health Hospitals will be furnished and paid by
the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau. The Aides will work directly
under the medical officers in direct contact with the
patient under the general supervision of the Medical
Officer in Charge of the hospital. The teachers and
workers in Pre-Vocational Training will operate
directly under the Educational Director of the hospital,
who in turn will be directly responsible to
the Commanding Officer or Medical Officer in Charge
of the Hospital.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>SUPPLIES</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>Supplies and equipment for the work in Physiotherapy
and Occupational Therapy and Pre-Vocational Training will
be furnished by the Public Health Service or upon request
of the Public Health Service by the U. S. Veterans’
Bureau.</p>

<h4 class='c032'><span class='under'>SUITABLE SPACE FOR WORK</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>It is necessary, in order to carry on the work in
Occupational Therapy and pre-vocational training to
have well lighted space, properly ventilated and heated,
suitable situated, and approximately, ten per cent
of the bed space in a hospital. This, however, does
not have to be in a ward, but may be provided in a
separate building.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The general outline of the policy is that to serve the men
in Occupational Therapy and pro-vocational training it will
require one teacher for every 20 men at work, or for every 40
men in a hospital, exclusive of the administrative force, as
it is estimated that only 50 per cent will be available
for this work. Experience has taught us that, where there
are 50 beds there will be 20 or more men available for this
work, and that in such small groups trade work should not be
undertaken, but in hospitals of 200 beds or more the work should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>be organized on the following lines—Occupational Therapy
for ward work and pre-vocational training, to include academic,
commercial, agricultural and trade work, as the survey of the
hospital indicates and as the Medical Officer in charge
may approve.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. In organizing the work in new hospitals a survey of the
needs and facilities shall be made to the Medical Division for
approval before the work is established. When the hospital
population has been so reduced in any unit that it is deemed
impracticable by the Medical Division to continue this work,
it may be closed at their direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. It will be necessary to have specially qualified and
experienced individuals in Central Office to be detailed to
the Inspection Section from the Reconstruction Section to make
inspections of the work in the hospitals, and approval for
travel authorization and expenses incurred by this personnel
is requested.</p>

<h4 class='c032'>3. Chief Nurse.</h4>

Central Office of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau through the Assistant Director
in Charge of Medical Division upon the recommendation of the District

of the Chief Nurses in the districts will be to superintend the activities
of the nurses in their respective districts, to visit the local offices
when directed by the District Medical Officer, to inspect the work of the
nurses, to co-ordinate the work of the nurses in the districts, sub-districts,

also be the duty of each Chief Nurse, through the District Medical Officer
and the District Manager, to keep the Superintendent of Nurses in the
Physical Reconstruction Section of the Medical Division, U. S. Veterans’
Bureau, informed of the quality of the work performed by the individual
nurses under her direction. Reports of especially good work, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>unsatisfactory work, should be sent in detail to the Superintendent of
Nurses through the District Medical Officer and the District Manager.
The Chief Nurse in each district will instruct nurses under her charge as
to the proper form for conducting correspondence and of the channels through
which the same will be sent.</p>

<h4 class='c032'>4. Duties of Nurses.</h4>

<h5 class='c027'><span class='under'>General Duties.</span></h5>

<p class='c020'>(a) To assist Medical Officers of the Districts, whenever
there is one at their station, in the care of beneficiaries who may require
medical supervision and care.</p>

<p class='c010'>(b) To keep contact with claimants and refer possible claimants
to the proper authorities for the adjustment of their needs.</p>

of the local or sub-district authority where there is no medical
officer on duty.</p>

<p class='c010'>(d) At station where there is a social service worker to refer
proper cases to them. If no co-operating social service agency is
available the nurses will perform such social service duties as time will
permit in addition to their regular duties.</p>

<p class='c010'>(e) Whenever the address of a beneficiary is found to be incorrect,
nurses will report correct addresses to the nearest Bureau Office
immediately.</p>

<p class='c010'>(f) Nurses, when visiting claimants, will give their residence
address for emergency calls to each claimant under their care and
supervision.</p>

<h5 class='c027'><span class='under'>Special Duties.</span></h5>

<p class='c020'>These may be grouped under three heads:</p>

<p class='c010'>1. For Tuberculosis Claimants:</p>

<p class='c010'>(a) Ascertain state of health from time to time. Record pulse,
temperature, etc., to detect evidence of tuberculous toxemia. Note gain or
loss of weight; presence of cough. Amount and character of sputum, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>(b) Ascertain their state of morale and that of their families.</p>

<p class='c010'>(c) Give simple instructions regarding health and appropriate
advice from time to time.</p>

<p class='c010'>(d) Furnish literature of appropriate character when same is
available.</p>

<p class='c010'>(e) Emphasize the value of hospital care for those who become
sick from other causes or whose pulmonary condition becomes active.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>(f) Report promptly to the nearest medical officer beneficiaries
whose condition seems to indicate that hospitalization is necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. For Neuro-Psychiatric Claimants:</p>

<p class='c010'>(a) Health instruction and definite advice with regard to home
conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>(b) Advice and supervision to prevent intemperance, excessive
use of tobacco, drugs, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>(c) Advice regarding habits, whether married or single.</p>

<p class='c010'>(d) Note general behavior and mental state, such as stream of
talk, mental activity, characteristics of same, such as incoherence, inattention,
distractibility, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>(e) Note mood of beneficiaries, such as preoccupations,
hallucinations, illusions, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>(f) Endeavor to obtain insight as to how much the patient
realizes the nature of his present condition or of previous illnesses.</p>

<p class='c010'>(g) Interpret claimant’s  condition to his family and instruct
them in the necessity for tolerance of claimant’s peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. For Claimants with General Disabilities.</p>

<p class='c010'>(a) Make visits to beneficiaries pending hospitalisation, or
after being discharged from hospital, while in training, particularly
those said to be absent from training on account of illness, reporting
results of investigations to the local medical officer. If an emergency
arises the claimant should be sent immediately to a designated physician,
if too ill to report to a physician, a physician in the employ of the
Bureau will be notified of the name and address of the patient and requested
call. A report on each case will be made to the nearest local office,
together with recommendations and a statement of any action that has been
taken. If Claimant’s absence from training was not due to illness that
fact will be communicated to the local Bureau authority.</p>

<p class='c010'>(b) Report on every case assigned to her and render subsequent
reports on such cases as may be required from time to time; to
make supplemental reports from time to time as may be necessary. Such reports
will be made on Medical E, or other designated form, and will have
for their object the discovery of present results of service disabilities,
intercurrent ailments, or physical conditions which are preventing the
physical rehabilitation of the man. The attention of the District or
local medical officer will be called to any seemingly improper conditions,
and recommendations will be made looking to their correction. Subsequent
reports will show whether or not these conditions have been remedied.
For the purpose of reducing the number of visits that are required the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>claimant will be induced to call at the office if practicable.</p>

<p class='c010'>(c) When calling at the home of a patient the nurse will
notice the sanitary conditions of the home, particular attention being
given to plumbing, adequacy of rooms, air space per capita, light, heat,
bathing facilities, number of flights of stairs necessary to reach quarters,
etc. Information as to how long claimant has lived there and if he
has made frequent changes of residence. Recommendations will be made for
improvement of conditions which appear to be prejudicial to the health
of the men and his <span class='under'>family</span> and an earnest endeavor will be made to have
them corrected. In case the <span class='under'>family</span> of a beneficiary needs medical treatment
or other attention the social worker or in her absence the Red Cross
or other Co-operating agency will be notified.</p>

<p class='c010'>(d) Reports on Medical G, or other designated form, will be
made on cases that break down in training, indicating when possible the
cause of the interruption of training, whether the same is actually due
to a reactivation of the original disability, to an intercurrent condition,
or to extrinsic causes connected with training, work, or living conditions.
Medical Form G, or other designated form, will be forwarded through proper
channels to the District Medical Officer or his nearest representative.</p>

<p class='c010'>(e) To visit at stated intervals all cases in localities in
which there are not county nurses, and to endeavor to obtain contact occasionally
with county nurses, where such are on duty, with a view of keeping
them informed of conditions for the best interest of the ex-service
man.</p>

<p class='c010'>(f) Field notes on all  of the above duties will be conveniently
kept on Assignment Memorandum Form 701, or other form that may be
designated hereafter.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. It is not the function of the nurses to supervise Vocational
Training. She is not to intimate to the beneficiary any doubt as to
whether he is assigned to the proper course, or whether institutional or
job training is best suited to his needs, but any suggestions she can
give to the Training Officer in regard to the man’s attitude towards his
training, will be helpful in his rehabilitation. Nurses will not call
men away from their work for the purpose of interviewing them, unless by
special arrangement, suggested by the Training Officer.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. In territory where a nurse and a Social Service worker are both
on duty, the nurse is not to attempt to investigate social conditions or
make recommendations for rectifying them, if unsatisfactory conditions are
found. <span class='under'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per contra</span></span> the Social Service worker is not to assume the work of
the nurse in investigating conditions affecting the health of the beneficiaries.
Emergency cases will arise where it will be obviously advantageous
to the interests of the beneficiaries for whether a nurse or a
Social Service worker to take immediate action on a matter not strictly
within her province, but when this has to be done the other should be at
once notified of the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>7. Nurses will not be expected to assist in special nursing except
in training centers, or in temporary emergencies when it is impossible
to hospitalize claimants, or where there is no person available
to give instruction in home nursing.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>ADMIRAL STITT: reminded the men that at the meeting yesterday afternoon
a motion was made to discuss the paper on the “The Social Service Worker”
this morning, and there were about 25 minutes for the discussion of
each of the four subjects—the social service worker, disciplinary
regulations, relation of district managers, and physiotherapy and
occupational therapy in hospitals.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. BLACKWOOD: said it was his opinion that the social service worker
has done more to aid the Commanding Officer and to follow up the work
on the ex-service man, as well as the service man, than anything
else he knew of that has been introduced into the hospitals. The
social service work in the Navy is all done by the Red Cross, one of
the most wonderful organizations in the United States for doing good.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON CHRONQUEST emphasized the point that diversion and recreation
should be distinguished from the social service, with which it is
so often linked.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON LASCHE: stated that at first he was sceptical about the introduction
of people under extraneous control into the hospital, but
that he incorporated the Red Cross into the official organization
of the hospital and made the director a member of the staff. He
believed in keeping a fairly close supervision over the activities
until he knew the individual, and made a rule that the social worker
should send a carbon of every letter written about the patients to
the officer in charge. It was found that at the beginning there was
no possible reason for about 30% of the letters written, but only
one-half of one percent of the letters produced harmful results. He
said he was inclined to think that owing to the fact that the Red
Cross has the benefit of a nation-wide organization that for the
present it is very much better to utilize their services than to
establish government employees to do the same work.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON: said that experience had shown him that the Red Cross is
a great aid in carrying on relation to the outside world. He told of
the situation in Atlanta. When the hospital was established he found
it would be necessary to satisfy the people of Atlanta that the
wounded boys were being properly taken care of, and was fortunate
to secure the services of a first-class man from the Red Cross. The
result was that the people became very interested in the work and
sent committees with food, also provided pictures two or three times
a week and all kinds of entertainment.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON PAYNE stated that one of the greatest difficulties he had
experienced had been in sidetracking the people who, though kindly
disposed, brought food and all kinds of entertainment which were
injurious to the patients. He said he did not believe in any kind
of athletics in a hospital, unless under the Physiotherapy Department,
neither did he believe in dances in a hospital. He said people
would bring in all kinds of food and the patients would eat it before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>going to mess, and then of course would complain of the hospital food
furnished. The greatest benefit from the Red Cross had been the
coordination of those activities.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON asked that some of the men who served in General Hospital #6
speak on this subject.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON WILLHITE: stated he had served under Colonel Bratton, and agreed
heartily with all he had said. He stated also that in his work in
the hospital in Philadelphia the Red Cross had done the finest kind of
social service work, coordinating all the agencies that Dr. Payne
spoke of as so detrimental to him, and he believed had been a very
great benefit rather than a hindrance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Dedman took up the work of the Red Cross in taking care of
relatives of patients who come to the hospital. Often these people
spend all their money for railroad fare, and have none left when
they reach the hospital, and the hospital has to take care of them.
He said he had arranged that four or five rooms be fixed up for
such people as this and believed some definite authority should be
had from the Veterans’ Bureau to house these people and furnish their
meals. He stated that some boys will ask for things and others
will not. He referred to an instance in which a patient had told
a lady that he needed a shirt, and two days later when she brought
him one she gave it to him before the whole ward and the boy was
ridiculed for a long time afterward. He had had trouble in getting
the work done through the social welfare workers in the hospital, as
the public wants the individual glory of handing something to the
boys themselves. The Red Cross has also been a great aid in investigating
home conditions of the patients, especially of tubercular
patients who want to go home to die. Also, in the case of a man who
asks for a long furlough because his mother or sister is dying, the
Red Cross will investigate and get an immediate report, and many times
it will be found that the mother or sister is not sick at all.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON PAYNE: stated that he did not want to be misunderstood, that he
did not mean to take credit away from the Red Cross.</p>

<p class='c018'>LIEUT. BOONE: stated that the discussions had gone afield, that real
social service work is summed up in four or five heads—securing
social histories and other data for the use of tuberculosis specialists
and psychiatrists, securing reports on home conditions for help of
physicians in deciding whether or not to discharge a patient to his
home, corresponding with home communities to adjust home situations,
thereby making it possible for patients to remain in hospitals, and
arranging through local communities for men who return home to have
proper care and assistance in adjusting themselves to civilian life.
He believed a great deal of this entertainment work should be separated
from social service.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>ADMIRAL STITT stated that the question had been considered by the Federal
Board of Hospitalization, and it had been recognized that only the
Red Cross has this tremendous machinery and it was considered that
the Red Cross is the proper agency and organization to take care of
that sort of thing. The Red Cross should coordinate and control these
outside agencies. He announced that the next discussion would be on
“Disciplinary Regulations”.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. KLAUTZ took up first that in tubercular institutions the rules
must always be stricter than in the general government hospital. He
emphasized the fact that tuberculosis in a civilian is the same as in
an ex-service man, that the same methods of procedure must be applied
in treatment, and that the patient must recognize the importance of
discipline in the tuberculosis hospital.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON DEDMAN stated he had taken part in the compilation of General
Order #27, and that he found one flaw in it now. This was the clause
about giving a man his transportation. He believed that a man would
soon get restless and if he could get his transportation home against
medical advice many of these men would get some wonderful home trips.
He said this would make it one of the hardest things on earth to keep
sick men in bed. He said the only way for this to be done would be
to deduct the transportation from the man’s compensation. He stated
that General Order 27 had put Commanding Officers where they could
sleep at night, that before there was simply turmoil and strife, like
the boy in France whose wife, every time she wrote to him, nagged him,
and he of course was never anxious to get her letters. Finally he
wrote to her “Dear Maggie—Received your last letter. For God’s sake
don’t write me any more. Let me fight this war in peace!.”</p>

<p class='c018'>DR.LLOYD: referring to Dr. Dedman’s complaint, stated that in the case
of a man discharged for disciplinary reasons the man would not have
the means to get home, and the community would have to take care of
him, that it was a choice between two evils. In the case of a man who
goes home against medical advice, if his transportation were not paid
he would just do something and get fired for disciplinary reasons. He
asked for some further discussions on the matter of patients being sent
back to a hospital when they ought not to be.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON MILLER: referring to General Order 27, stated that in his hospital
the patients were willing to pay their own transportation, and would go
whether it was paid or not.</p>

<p class='c018'>ADMIRAL STITT: asked that those who wished to present resolutions be
writing them.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. GUTHRIE: requested that the medical officers who have complaints in
regard to General Order 27 and do not have time to express then write
them out and he would be very glad to have them sent to him.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>SURGEON WHITE (Speedway Hospital): asked whether, if a patient stays away
over night A.W.O.L., paragraphs 3 or 4 on Page 3 of General Order
27–A would apply.</p>

<p class='c018'>ADMIRAL STITT asked that Dr. Lloyd answer that question.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. LLOYD: suggested that if patient stays away less than 24 hours mild
disciplinary action might be applied, if longer than 24 hours he
should be disciplined, that these matters were covered in the paragraphs
referred to.</p>

<p class='c018'>ADMIRAL STITT: “The next discussions will be on “The Relation of District
Managers to Hospitals.””</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WILLIAMS: emphasized the point that when a man comes to the hospital
he should be treated for everything that is wrong with him.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON BROWNE: wished to report a plan in operation in Boston. Every
two weeks a luncheon conference is held, at which are present the
Commanding Officers of the hospitals, the head of the American Legion
in the State, head of the New England Red Cross, and the Commissioner
of State Aid and Pensions. In this way it was possible to straighten
out all difficulties and there is now practically no friction between
these departments.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. ELLIOTT: spoke on the contact with the District Manager here in
Washington, that it was very easy to reach him by telephone and obtain
advice which facilitates the discharge and treatment of patients
very much. The relation of the Naval Hospital with the District
Manager has been one of greatest cooperation, that the Veterans’
Bureau had even gone so far as to lend a typist and stenographer to
help in the great amount of clerical work necessary in making out
papers for Veterans’ Bureau patients.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another man spoke of the multiplicity of paper work necessary in
connection with the new form adopted by the Veterans’ Bureau in place
of 1934–B, that it was impossible to manifold this form and it necessitated
just twice as much work as before. He suggested that the
Committee on Forms consider the feasibility of adopting forms that
can be manifolded and thereby make economical saving.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON YOUNG: stated that in regard to the relation of the District
Manager he would like to know whether the representative of the Veterans’
Bureau to be in the hospital is to be there as a man directly
connected with the personnel of the District Manager’s office, or
whether he is to be there as a representative of the Veterans’ Bureau
itself.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. RAWLS gave the information that the educational director would be
a representative of the District Manager, on the staff of the Commanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>Officer of the hospital, who would deal with the District Office
in matters pertaining to the District and to the hospitalization of
the patient. He stated that it might be that in dealing with certain
other phases he would have a direct channel to the Bureau, but this
had not been definitely decided.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: stated that the subject of hospitalization most now be
viewed as a much broader field than ever before, that after discussing
the subject of an educational department and social service work
with people in contact with it it was decided to be absolutely necessary
to enlarge the personnel of these hospitals so as to take in
these various new things which were coming up for consideration. He
emphasized the fact that the end result is the important thing, but
that in consideration of all of these subjects it should be understood
that these Red Cross representatives and all other employees will be
subject to the Commanding Officer. He said he was satisfied that
most of the complaint made was by individuals who come into the hospital
and do not come in contact with the Commanding Officer. The
whole idea of the social service relation is that these men shall be
made more resourceful and more capable of earning a living for themselves.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. EVANS: took up the number of personnel required, and stated that
it had been approved that the average requirements would be—one
teacher or one occupational therapist for each twenty individuals
actually engaged, and one physiotherapy aide for each twenty treatments
per day. He stated that one might not take care of over five
patients, but the basis of estimation was one for twenty, and that the
average would be one to sixteen if the educational director and his
clerical help are included.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON SPRAGUE: spoke on the value of occupational therapy. He told how
after the introduction of occupational therapy in his hospital in New
York boys who had been very troublesome before became deeply interested
in the work and the wards became as quiet as any other wards. He
wished to express himself as most heartily in favor of occupational
therapy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another discussion on this subject followed. It was stated that there
is no question as to the direct therapeutic value of occupational
therapy. The disciplinary value is its greatest value. Very often,
too, there will be found a boy who has real talent.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON PAYNE: stated that in his opinion a simpler method of reporting
should be adopted, that the system of bookkeeping is perfectly idiotic
and that nobody knows just what is meant. He said there was a great
deal of sentiment against the Government having any interest in what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>the man makes, and that in many cases the men buy their own material.
He cited the case of a man in his hospital who makes all kinds of toys
out of tin cans and has worked up quite a trade. Public sentiment is
all on that man’s side.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. BRATTON: with regard to paying transportation for men discharged for
disciplinary reasons, made the following motion, which was carried;</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='under'><em class='gesperrt'>MOTION</em></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>That the Director of the Veterans’ Bureau be
requested to secure legislation so that the
expenses of the patient’s transportation to his
bona fide home, when he has been discharged for
disciplinary reasons, be deducted from his
compensation, when compensation is being given,
or may be given thereafter.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. KLAUTZ: said it was his opinion that it was better to put a man right
on the train and send him home.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. BLACKWOOD: “In view of the remarks made at this meeting yesterday
in regard to the nurses, and in view of the fact that Congress is
contemplating the question of pay for the services, I would like to
present this resolution:”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='under'><em class='gesperrt'>RESOLUTION</em></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>Be it resolved that it is the sense of this meeting
that the pay of the nurses of all branches of
the Government service is far below what it should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>be and therefore is a detriment to the
entrance to or continuance in those
services of the better type of nurses,
and that it be urged upon Congress by
the Federal Board of Hospitalization that
legislation be enacted to remedy this
condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>This resolution was adopted.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. KLAUTZ: offered the following resolution, which was also
adopted:</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='under'><em class='gesperrt'>RESOLUTION</em></span></div>

</div>

<p class='c028'>That a standard procedure be adopted for
the treatment, medical supervision and
control of tuberculous patients in all
Government hospitals for ex-service men,
including uniformity in matters of furlough,
application of occupational therapy and
pre-vocational training, as far as it may
be possible, without sacrificing individualization
of treatment.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: In arranging the program of this afternoon, we wish you to
consider it as open for discussion for bringing to the attention of the
Conference any subject which you may have in mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have divided the work in this way. In order that we might have
some leading thought from which to start and upon which to base our discussions,
I would remind you that in the n.p, and tubercular case, the
Government has its greatest liability.</p>

<p class='c010'>I would remind you also that particularly in the n.p. case the
medical man has his greatest responsibility.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have learned by comparison month by month since taking over this
work that the general medical case has already become a quite rapidly
decreasing case in numbers. We find, however, that the mental case and
the tubercular subject are both increasing in number. We realize that in
the general medical case ultimately we must get to a place where we shall
have finished largely with that character of case.</p>

<p class='c010'>But with the n.p. case we know that so long as we have a remnant
of the World War Army in existence, we have these neuro-psychiatric cases
under our observation.</p>

<p class='c010'>I would like to charge you, while I have this opportunity, with
this particular responsibility on your part, and I would like to tell you
how I think you can do greater justice to the soldier and how you can
certainly help your Government best in considering this subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>For myself, after a very close personal contact of ten years in the
specialty of treating mental and nervous diseases, I am satisfied that in
99% of all of these cases,—perhaps that is a little strong,—I should
say in 90 per cent of these cases you will find, where the case is genuine,
that you have some physical cause at the bottom of the mental trouble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Therefore I wish to suggest that in the consideration of this case,
that you never allow one of them to pass you excepting you give him the
most careful examination; that you go over him in the most thorough way;
that you look into his case, so far as his history is concerned, taking
into consideration the decade in which he is living; go over it with every
laboratory refinement of diagnostic assistance that you can possibly give
and see if you cannot find somewhere some physical trouble that is behind
the mental symptoms.</p>

<p class='c010'>For myself, I am convinced that there is no case, excepting those
that have gone on to the degenerate class of diseases, which usually appear
after fifty, but has some physical derangement the overcoming of
which may help very materially in the curing of the case.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>So I would like to emphasize this thought: that you have not exhausted
the service that you can render, you have not relieved yourselves
of the responsibility, you have not acted as loyal doctors of modern times
should have acted, excepting that you take the greatest care in the preliminary
examination of these patients.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then I would like to emphasize also that your preliminary examination,
by comparison with frequently recurring examinations, so long as
they are under your observation, will help you very materially.</p>

<p class='c010'>I wish you to know that I am impressed with this idea. This is what
I believe:</p>

<p class='c010'>That many of these cases that come to you will be better off outside
of institutions than in them, and I want you all, all of you, to help us
to try and correct this impression that is now existing, that the Government
does not give this class of cases proper attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the Government is not giving them proper attention, it is not
because of their disposition to do so, but it is because they have not
had time enough to develop resources by which they can handle these cases
well.</p>

<p class='c010'>I would feel that I have not performed my function here as a doctor
if I did not say to you to be thus careful in your diagnosis and then help
to work out a plan whereby, if this subject cannot be made well, he can at
least be made more self-dependent. Use all of your influence to help to
cite where these men can find niches into which they can go and make it
possible through the influence you can bring to bear upon the people who
are associated and connected with them that they are better when they really
are established in their homes. There is no case in the world that
is more unfairly treated than the neuro-psychiatric case. We all know
that by many experiences and observations. So let us give particular and
special attention to this subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>They say to us we have no specialists in this line. I am not so
sure but we are better off for that. This is what I do believe: that
every man who has broad experience of a general practice of medicine is
competent and capable of quickly developing himself to conduct these
cases along carefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>You have no greater field, men, either for yourselves, for the
patient, or for your Government, than in this field.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now as to the tubercular case. The error we find in the matter
of the tubercular case is this: We find a great many cases are diagnosed
tubercular when really they are not,—a very bad impression, as
you can imagine, to give to any subject. So let us be very sure, let
us leave no influence, or power, or activity unused that will help us to
define the exact attitude of these cases.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>We know, as was related here yesterday, that many of the so-called
cases of shell shock are really due to other causes. This is my own
observation of those cases, we had a number immediately after the war,
at the Institution with which I am connected, and we found a most invariably
these men were the subject of the toxemias of fatigue, and by relieving
the toxemic conditions, whether it be uremic infection, or what
not, these cases soon got well and their mental symptoms soon subsided.
So be sure that you be perfectly fair with these men, and you are never
fair with them until you have exhausted every resource in discovering whether
or not, as the basis of their mental or nervous disturbance, there
may not be some physical condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>The meeting is now in charge of Dr. White.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WHITE: I hope there will be free discussion of this matter. There
are a good many men who have had charge of neuro-psychiatric hospitals,
and I hope you will feel free to get up and briefly set forth such
vital problems as you may have in mind. In order that we may cover as
many problems as possible, I will, with your permission, let you know
when the five minutes is up, so we can cover the ground as fully as
possible.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. KOLB: In relation to the examinations made of these neuro-psychiatric
cases which were sent to us, I want to outline the procedure we use at
Waukesha in arriving at correct diagnosis and methods of treatment.
The patient is given to one special doctor. This doctor is supposed
to make the first preliminary examination, which included a complete
physical, neurological and psychiatric examination, and do all the
work in connection with these patients while in hospital. In making
this examination we have on our staff a number of very competent attending
specialists in order that we can obviate the mistake General
Sawyer has mentioned of assuming that these men are simply neurotics
and passing over important physical conditions. By this method we
have caught a number of cases which have been passed over as cases of
neurasthenia. For instance, I have in mind a case diagnosed neurasthenia
which was treated six months ago, which was a case of brain
tumor.</p>

<p class='c010'>After we have made the first preliminary examination the man is
carefully observed in hospital, not only by his own officer but by the
clinical director, and notes are made from time to time. Examinations
are also made by the dentist, x-ray examinations and various laboratory
examinations, including serological and base metabolism. In the end,
after all the data is assembled and written up, he is brought to the
staff and there his case is thoroughly discussed by all the members of
the staff; a diagnosis is arrived at, methods of treatment discussed
and afterwards put into effect.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>Now as to the organic conditions with which our neurotics suffer. It
is true a large proportion of them do have organic disorders in connection
with their neuroses. We find that most of them do have functional disorders
originating purely in their mind, or because of some constitutional
nervous defect and that the real fundamental condition from which they are
suffering is not an organic condition but is nervous or mental and must be approached
along lines of psycho-therapy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now I will not go into the subject of psycho-therapy. We pay special
attention to mental questions but we do not neglect the physical by any
means. Every physical disorder which is found is corrected, if correction
is possible. We have complete physio-therapy and occupational therapy and
all other facilities for treating nervous cases. We are careful never to
stress too much on the physical treatment we give these patients, because
by so doing we suggest to them conditions they really do not have and by
that means prolong their functional disorders.</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding occupational therapy. We all know that this is a very important
method of treatment. It should always, as Colonel Evans said, be
directed treatment and should not be given in a hap-hazard way. All of
our occupational therapy treatment has been given a definite prescription.
For eighteen months we have had a bright young medical officer interested
in this subject, whom we have made reconstruction officer and who observes
the effect of treatment and changes the prescriptions of the other physicians
when he finds the treatment given does not have the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>With reference to reconstruction aides, every week our reconstruction
officer gives them a talk on some phase either of occupational therapy or
physio-therapy or of mental disorders. We cover any subject in which the
neuro-psychiatrist should be interested. This officer has devised a system
of observation which the aides are supposed to make on patients and which
they do make on each patient who takes occupational therapy and which is
looked over by our reconstruction officer and the officer in special charge
of the case. We are getting up data and statistics which we think will be
of interest to the general profession when it is finally published,</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. TREADWAY: I think that the Public Health Service has had a very grave
and serious problem affecting the N.P. Veterans of the World War.
We have included in that term, besides the mental and nervous cases,
the neuro-surgical cases as well.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are a number of problems which still confront us, and one of
these is the question of personnel. I am sorry that Dr. Kolb did not say
something about the training school he had started in connection with his
hospital. We sent some young officers over to learn technique and methods
of handling the psycho-neurotics. We have also sent some officers to the
Public Health Service clinic at the Psychopathic Institute in Boston and
we hope that some of our other hospitals will start a similar school. The
question of personnel is an exceedingly grave one. A great many young
men want to become surgeons.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>They are not interested in mental or nervous cases.  They want to go into
general medicine. Last year we sent two officers to the Southern University
and to the Northern and Western universities to meet the graduating
classes and the internes, and from that we have been recruiting some
younger men who are manifesting considerable interest. We hope to get
additional personnel by interesting the young graduate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another problem is the question of creating, in connection with
General hospitals, wards where patients of this sort may receive at the
beginning of their treatment, their preliminary examination, where they
may be evacuated home with compensation or without compensation, or evacuated
to a prolonged treatment hospital for further care.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has sometimes been difficult to get enough men, trained personnel,
to man these wards.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have believed all along that the proper method of treating the
pyscho-neurotic, so-called, is in out-patient clinic and we have attempted
to develop out-patient clinics with the old dispensaries maintained
by the Public Health Service; but the question of personnel again entered
into it, and we were unable to develop as many out-patients clinics
as we should like. We think, however, that the mild, mental case, as
General Sawyer has said, is far better off in the outside world than he
is in an institution. If such cases go to a hospital, it tends to have
their symptoms crystallized and they believe they are sicker than they
really are. In other words, they seek out some minor physical disability
as a peg on which to hang what they think is a grave disorder.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of compensation for these cases is an important one
which must be worked out. The man who believes he is seriously ill when
he has but a minor defect, if he has compensation and has a weak will,
will not make a strenuous effort to get back on his feet. The question of
maximum compensation for these cases many times interferes with rehabilitation.</p>

<p class='c010'>We believe that this is a new method of handling mental patients and
it may serve as a copy to other States to prevent this enormous building
program which every State has had to go through and which has not met the
needs of the insane.</p>

<p class='c010'>Compensation for epileptics and their examination is a very important
question and has been a serious problem to us.</p>

<p class='c010'>We find among neuroses not infrequently mild convulsions. We don’t
know a great deal about these convulsions; some are epileptic and some are
not. The true epileptic, however, has great difficulty in making a go in
the outside world. The number of convulsions per month is not an indication
of his disability, entirely, because the passage of the Employees Compensation
Act in the several States, has interfered with the employment of men
with an epileptic past.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>It is as hard for the man who has a seizure once a month to get a position as
the one with four, so the question of treating epileptics is one largely of
social service and compensation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hospitalization of epileptics has not been a success in the hands of
the Public Health Service. One of the Western States that built a large
colony for epileptics some years ago has now turned it into an institution for
feeble-minded.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of vocational training is also a big problem in connection
with this type of disability. A man, for example, whom I saw a few weeks ago,
had been a jewelry polisher in Boston. Before the war he had to get up every
morning early and go to his work. He gave most of his earnings to his family.
He was suddenly taken out of that situation by the draft and put into a situation
where it was simple for him. All he had to do was to get up and move
around when some one told him to. He was furnished with his clothing; he was
furnished with his food. When he got over on the other side he painted a
rosy picture about how things were at home. When he got back home it was
not like what he imagined it was. He had to get up and go back to his old
job. It was hard for him to make the effort. He quit his job. He goes to
the Vocational people (he had a seventh-grade education). He wants to become
a civil-engineer. Obviously he cannot. He tries another occupation,
etc. Now the attempt of that man to better his condition is a laudable one,
but very often that desire to get away from a difficult situation is a part
of his mental disorder. He must be made to understand and meet that problem
frankly and not be seeking round-about paths without very much continuity of
purpose. Vocational training in connection with epileptics has not been very
successful. Dr. Ellison who has had charge of a hospital for epileptics can
give us some valuable information on the problems of the epileptics.</p>

<p class='c010'>I think that Dr. Wilbur, who has had charge of a large station at Chicago,
can give us some valuable information about preliminary examinations, the social
service aspect of these cases, the need of social service and the handling of
the psychoneurotic in out-patient clinics. Dr. Wilbur and Dr. Chronquest can
tell us about the problem affecting the insane. Mr. Chairman, I suggest that
you call on them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. ELLISON: I want to say the program as outlined in the afternoon session
is one of vital interest to me, because I have been in charge of one of the
most problematic Government Institutions in the country, that is, an epileptic
hospital in East Norfolk. The administrative program in hospital of this
kind, taking into consideration the application of general orders, hospital
regulations and internal regulations as within the hospital, is entirely different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>from any other class of hospital under Federal control.</p>

<p class='c010'>The very fact that you attempt to apply certain regulations in a hospital
of this kind where the morale is naturally at a low ebb, due to the
mental phases under which these men are suffering, sometimes results in
disaster and the breaking down of the morale you have in the hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>I would like to go on record in stating it is my belief that voluntary
hospitalization of the epileptic is anything but desirable.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the standpoint of rehabilitation of the epileptic, I must take into
consideration the particular type of epileptic we have in the hospital. As
Dr. Treadway stated, the majority of these man have not reached probably
the school grade of seven years. There has been an attempt on the part of
the rehabilitation department to make lawyers, doctors, diplomats out of
these epileptics. It is absurd and cannot be done. These men are social and
economic lepers, so far as their rehabilitation is concerned. The communities
do not want them. Their families do not want them and the responsibility
for their care rests upon the Government. Then what is to be the solution
of the disposition of these men? I can see but probably two solutions to
the question. Voluntary hospitalisation is out of the question. I believe
that that part of the Bureau concerned with the compensation of these men,
from an economical standpoint, must take into consideration the question of
the grouping of these epileptics. There is a class which can live at home.
There is another class, not definitely formidable, which does need
custodial care. Then there is the psychiatric epileptic who needs psychopathic
institutional care. In arriving at the disposition of these men you
must take into consideration those three groups.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then there is another group, there is a mixed group of epileptics. In
many instances we have noted, after a long period of observation, that a man
may react to some situation, starting out in a hysterical seizure and wind
up in a definite epileptic attack. That has been true in quite a number of
cases and I should like to urge upon the Bureau District officers and those
concerned, this one thing:</p>

<p class='c010'>In referring cases to East Norfolk, I think a very careful examination
should be made of these men to determine as nearly as possible that they are
epileptics.</p>

<p class='c010'>At East Norfolk there is a situation existing which I have endeavored to
correct; that is hospitalizing psycho-neurotics,—neuropsychiatry cases
which are not definitely epileptic, which are made worse by contact with the
epileptic patient. These men are being made worse every day. Some of them
simulate very closely the epileptic; many have learned to bite their tongues
as the epileptic does. They should not be hospitalized; about 25% of the
cases are not epileptic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>I think that should be taken into consideration and a careful survey made of
these patients before they are transferred to East Norfolk.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to these cases, very much the same program is carried out as Dr. Kolb’s.
Complete preliminary physical and neurological examinations are made and
patients are placed under observation of one man, who observes them and makes
notes from time to time. As for the treatment of these men, there is little
to be done in a way. I think it resolves itself into occupation mostly. I
think the occupational measure as applied to the epileptic is the only solution.
I think they should be kept busy every moment, for many reasons. They
are naturally fault finding and if they have something to do it will lessen
the time they have to think of these things. It will promote interest in
their surroundings. It will lessen the liability of deterioration but as the
thing now stands that cannot be done, under the present method of hospitalization.
The solution covering that is, I believe, for the Government to formulate,
properly taking into consideration these districts, and build an epileptic
colony, under proper supervision, and I believe from an economic standpoint,
it could be made almost self-supporting.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the medical treatment, we have been instituting at East
Norfolk a very careful treatment,—careful observation—to determine the real
value of luminol in the treatment of epilepsy and we have found that it has
been beneficial in many ways; that it lessens the severity of the shock, prolongs
the intervals between shocks and in many instances effects complete cessation;
the patient becomes more alert, more active, more interested in his
surroundings. This treatment must be continued day after day. If there is
a cessation, or lack of it, or a failure or inability on our part to obtain
luminol, these men immediately react to the lack of it. I should say we have
had at least four deaths at East Norfolk due absolutely to the lack of luminol.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WILBUR: At Chicago we developed a diagnostic clinic at the Marine Hospital
and had two departments: in-patient and out-patient departments. We
had a capacity for in-patients of about 150. The out-patient department was
unlimited and developed to approximately  160 to 175 patients at one time.
The in-patient department is divided into five groups for the investigation of
cases;</p>

<p class='c010'>1. Cases which would be immediately transferred to some other
hospital as soon as arrangements could be made;</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Certain disorders taken up under direction of an officer
particularly interested in such disorders and investigated as fully as possible;</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Hyper-thyroidism, following operations, where the pulse is
still high. When such cases were sent to us, an attempt was made to stabilize
the patient and bring him down to a nearly normal basis so that he could
go out and take Federal Board training.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Psycho-neurotics.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. Epileptic and hysterical cases.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>I might say that out of every fifteen cases sent in with diagnosis of
epilepsy, about twelve or thirteen of them proved, after careful observation
for a period of from two to three months, to be hysterical. That was about
our ratio on cases sent in.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our procedure was much like Dr. Kolb’s at Waukesha. The man was given
complete physical, neurological, examination first. We had a special consultant
who visited the hospital about once a week. After a man had his examination,
he was checked as needing further examination in eye, ear, nose and
throat, or x-ray,—whatever was indicated in the case, and that was tabulated
on the chart and checked against his examination. At the end of that time
each ward surgeon prepared a summary of the case and a decision was made as
to whether the patient needed a short term of treatment in our own hospital,—we
had there occupational therapy and other methods of treatment,—and
then be discharged and sent back to his home.</p>

<p class='c010'>In connection with the in-patient hospital work, we had a committee at
the district supervisor’s office made up of one representative at the Bureau
of War Risk Insurance, one from the Federal Board, the neuro-psychiatric
contact officer and one representative from the Public Health Service. We
tried to place the men in some definite schedule,—the Federal Board, if
possible, after he was discharged from the hospital, and we would bring our
problem cases to this meeting, where they would be taken up and such arrangements
made for their further treatment as necessary. The contact man visited
the station once or twice a week to familiarize himself with the problems of
each man.</p>

<p class='c010'>The out-patient department was naturally on a different schedule; that is,
certain hours of the day were set aside and definite offices assigned to the
out-patient department; they kept track of their own patients, who reported
in at intervals of two or three times a week, every two or three weeks, according
to the needs of the case. If the man needed some special treatment,
he came into the hospital for that treatment and at the same time he saw this
ward surgeon and talked the case over with him. Just as soon as that patient
was ready for vocational training, he was put into touch with our contact
officer and a schedule was made out for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the vocational training for epileptics, a great many cases
during the year I was at Chicago, came up to that board for consideration.
We tried the epileptic at various occupations; kept him away from machinery
so as no injury would come to him, and we succeeded in rehabilitating only
two epileptics out of the whole group. These two were given positions in
factories that were owned or governed by some relative or friend who had
taken an interest in then, disregarding the compensation laws and disregarding
the inability of the men to work when they would have a seizure. In two
instances only have we succeeded in putting men into training where it proved
a success.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>DR. MCLAKE: I represent the National Sanitorium in Marion, Indiana.
Presume all of you have heard more or less about it. It was organized
about a year ago; opened on the first of January as a sanitorium.
During the past year we have cared for about 1500 patients. The present
Census is 800.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now this institution was opened under a provision that it was to be
used for the hospitalization of reasonably curable cases. In other
words, it was not to be an asylum. It was not a place for merely
domiciliary residence or custodial care. The needs of hospitalization,
however, this year, have been such that we have taken all sorts of cases.
As this has been a matter of discussion for many hospitals and in many
districts, I want to take half a minute to show you that during the past
year and at the present time, I am hospitalizing at Marion nearly every
variety of n.p. case which we have.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the present time we have had no special accommodation whatsoever
for n.p.-t.b. patients. Our institution is built on the
cottage plan and in the preliminary survey and construction no provision
was mode for t.b. patients. However, at the present time I have
one ward which is filled with eleven of these cases. I may say in this
connection that we are expecting to build a t.b.-n.p. unit of eighty
beds and will start construction in about five or six months, which will
be gratifying to you men who have these combined cases and would like to
unload them and as soon as we can take these cases off your hands we will
be glad to do so.</p>

<p class='c010'>In that connection I want to emphasize one thing: that in your general
hospitals and in your t.b. hospitals you get many cases toward the end of
this t.b. condition, which present n.p. symptoms. Now I know from experience
at Fort Bayard and in other t.b. sanitoriums, especially at
Fort Bayard, where I was associated several years with Colonel Burke,
that these patients become exceedingly troublesome and exceedingly annoying.
However, if you are perfectly frank with yourself and perfectly
frank with the n.p. man, you will admit that these cases are not primarily
n.p. cases, but cases of terminal toxemia. I don’t believe myself that
these cases should be hospitalized as n.p. I believe in your t.b. hospitals
you should set aside a ward or two or three wards where you can take
care of your terminal toxemias whose symptoms are principally mental;
they should not be unloaded on the n.p. hospitals which are built and
equipped for reasonably curable cases of n.p. disease.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to what General Sawyer said about many of these n.p. cases living
outside. I want to most heartily indorse that attitude, and I will say
in that connection that during the past year I have turned out between
two and three hundred men because I firmly believe in that view. My
method for turning out these n.p. cases is as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>After a final conference on a man after preliminary observation, if
we feel that he has come to the point where he should be given a chance,
we give that man a thirty-day parole. If he has a guardian, his guardian
must report every ten days. If he has not a guardian he is placed in communication
with the Veterans’ Bureau officer, or a Red Cross worker in the
District, in which he is paroled.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>In other words, during the first thirty days I get three reports as to his
condition. If after thirty days he is still doing well, I grant an extension
of thirty days. During the second thirty days he reports in twice. If he
is still doing well at the end of sixty days, the parole is extended to
ninety. I believe in the majority of our cases that if a man makes good
for ninety days, it is reasonable to suppose that he is going to make sufficient
adjustment to stay outside of the institution. If, as I said, his
report at the end of ninety days is a good one, he is then discharged from
the Institution, with the privilege, of course, of returning. Now of all
the men I have sent out under that scheme this year, I have had less than
eight per cent of returns, and I consider that in the first year a fairly
good average.</p>

<p class='c010'>I want to commend that scheme to every man who has charge of an n.p.
hospital and after this conference adjourns, I would like to correspond
with you on that subject. I would like to compare notes because I believe
it is worthy of attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one other thing brought up in a previous meeting and that was
the question of our constitutional psychopath, and drug addict and the building
of special hospitals for these men. I personally am not in favor of
such a scheme and I will tell you why. I have a considerable number of
these men. I believe that every complete n.p. hospital should have a department
with definite numbers assigned from the staff who are particularly
clever in handling this line of case. I think that they should be handled
in your regular n.p. hospital as a separate unit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now there is just one thing in connection with that statement I wish to
emphasize. There are a certain number of these men who do eventually make
an adjustment. For the sake of that percentage alone we should not place
the stigma upon them of being sent to practically a penal institution, and
that is what it means if you set aside a place and brand it as a place for
those of criminal tendencies and drug addicts. We tried that in New York
and you all know from the papers what it resulted in.</p>

<p class='c010'>There has been another plea. Dr. Treadway spoke of the shortage of personnel.
It is acute everywhere in every department. Then on top of that
comes the plea from the general hospital men, from the t.b. hospital men,
for neuro-psychiatrists to be assigned to his staff. That is a physical
impossibility. There are not enough n.p. men to go around and I have a
solution of that which I have put up to numerous men and that is just this.
Along with what General Sawyer said today about every one’s being a well-rounded
out man, every man who has charge of a hospital, every man who is
on the staff of a hospital taking care of ex-service men ought to go down
and buy a copy of White’s Outlines and study it for the next six months.
If you will do that you don’t need specialists on your staff. You can make
a near enough diagnosis so you will be reasonably certain in 95% of your
cases as to whether they ought to be sent to an n.p. hospital or not.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>DR. FULLER: I an particularly interested in the question of personnel.
The shortage of neuro-psychiatric trained personnel and physicians
is a real and very acute problem. We have any number of vacancies for
such men in the Public Health Service at the present time. I dare say
the same conditions exist in the Army and Navy. I believe that the
only way of solving the problem that Dr. McLake spoke of is for the
Commending Officers of those hospitals who have one psychiatrist on
their staff,—and practically all the large hospitals have one on
their staff,—to insist that these psychiatrists interest other
members of the staff. The fact that Dr. Treadway brought out, that
most young men are not interested in psychiatry is due to the fact
they do not know anything about it. I was one of the men who visited the
schools last year. I was suddenly confronted by statements made by the
deans or their assistants: “Oh, neuro-psychiatry, I don’t expect you
will get much enthusiasm from any of the schools on that subject, because
that is a post-graduate subject and we don’t make any attempt to teach it
during the under-graduate years.” Any number of young men who will state a
preference for general medicine can be interested in this subject about
which they know nothing. The solution, therefore, depends upon the
commanding officers of these hospitals and upon the psychiatrists on their
staffs; depends upon their willingness to detail one or more young men
to the psychiatrists, who are interested in the subject. I don’t believe
that the problem is going to be solved in any other way because there are
not enough men outside who are willing to come into the Government service,
who are interested.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. MILLER: We have a specialist at Oteen who lectures to our entire medical
staff Tuesday and Friday of each week. They are very much interested
in it and we think it is a very great benefit to the institution and
the patients.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. EVANS: What are you going to do with the group the doctor describes
that ought to be in a colony? What are you going to do with the mentally
deficient who will never be able to carry on? There is no appropriation
available for that group. If the Soldiers’ Homes are not properly supplied
with means or some other special effort made, every community will have
these individuals as a reproach upon them, and it occurs to me there is
no group of men that would be as able as this group to have the propaganda
go forward that there is a problem to be solved in these cases.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WHITE: I had this in mind about some of these difficult problems,
some of these border-line cases I didn’t have a chance to speak of the
other morning. I suggested there in just a word that in connection
with these disciplinary measured such as have recently been promulgated
in this order we got this morning, No. 27–A, probably we shall
have to come to some form of disciplinary treatment with a considerable
group of these border-line cases, and the plea I wanted to make was that
discipline should not be used as discipline per se, but that we should
seek for all of the possibilities that are incorporated in disciplinary
measures which can be brought to bear upon the patient for his welfare;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>In other words, if we can make out of discipline a therapeutic tool.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now we are dealing for the most part, in these border-line cases
and in the delinquent group, with types of individuals that are more
or less defective. Almost all of them are defective in some sort of
way, not necessarily intellectually defective but frequently on the
affective side; but there undoubtedly has to be some kind of disciplinary
pressure brought to bear.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have in mind a fellow who is a high-grade defective, who has
passed through a praecox attack, who has come back to comparative normality.
He is a reasonably useful citizen around the institution but
he can’t get on outside the institution and he has periods of not getting
on well in the institution, because every once in a while he will go
out and get drunk. Now what are you going to do with that sort of fellow?
Such an individual does not always stand discipline very well.
A doctor came to me and talked to me about him the other day and wanted
to know what should we do with this fellow. I said, “Shut him up; take
his privileges away from him and watch him very carefully, because I
don’t believe he will stand shutting up very well. When you have made the
maximum impression upon him from that discipline, let him cut.” You
have constantly to shift between severity and almost lack of discipline with
these people to keep them at their level, and you have to realize all the
time it is a matter of very fine adjustment and that after all you can
very easily do them a great deal of harm. Therefore I am always more or
less disturbed by the constant effort that is being made in bodies like
this to standardize all kinds of rules and regulations, because I realize
that in this class of cases particularly there are individual problems
and they must be left for the individual judgment of the physician who
has charge of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have, for example, a clerk in the office, a man who is probably
sixty odd years of age. When he is sober he is as efficient a clerk as
we have in our office, but he persistently gets drunk and stays drunk
for days at a time. Now the easiest thing on earth is to discharge that
man. What is going to become of him? He can’t take care of himself.
He has a family dependent upon him. That would mean to pauperize him
and make him a public charge. I developed some time ago a method of dealing
with him. I penalized him every time he got drunk by taking away a
certain amount of his pay. It was hard punishment. He does not get much
pay. The result was I pushed him to the limit, because it cost him too
much to drink. The result was he had longer periods of sobriety than
he ever had before, but he did break down once in a while, and when he did
we had to forgive him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now we have to deal with that sort of problem among our employees
and patients, and we are put to it constantly to devise out of our ingenuity
how best to meet it; and one of the agencies at our command is the
disciplinary measure, which, if wisely enforced, can be used to push the
patient to the highest possibility of his adjustment.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>Then, in that connection, as to our friends, the morons and epileptics.
I am fond of saying that practically everybody, no matter how
defective he may be, has a certain capacity for usefulness. There is
almost nobody who is, under proper arrangements, a total loss socially.
A Moron, of six or seven years of age, may be ten per cent efficient.
He may be ten per cent efficient under one set at social conditions,
maybe fifteen per cent efficient under another set. He may be total loss
under other sets of conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now a lot of these people, like the young fellow I spoke of a while
ago, are very useful citizens in the hospital community. They would be a
total liability outside that community. We have always had these people
in the community and we always shall have them probably. It is perhaps
a worth-while endeavor to try to get the community, through these various
social agencies, to appreciate them for certain values. One of the medical
officers of the Army was discussing with me, a while ago, this problem in
the South, in the cotton mill districts, where there is a large number of
mentally deficient people. They do not do much of anything, except perhaps,
drink whiskey, breed and make trouble. They go into the mills and either
get injured or discharged. A lot of that material is really capable of
utilization. The mental defectives, as a whole, are fairly good natured and
tractable. There were lots of mental defectives in the Army, enlisted men,
who carried on and made good soldiers. Some young fellows went into the
Army from the School of Feeble Minded, in Massachusetts, and had excellent
records. The Superintendent there kept track of his feeble-minded boys in
the Army, and they made excellent records because they belong to that type
of individual which has a very strong leaning upon persons in authority
and will follow his officer like a Newfoundland dog his master, will obey
orders to the letter and they make most valuable persons. So this officer
suggested to me that these feeble-minded groups running around might
be assembled into industrial units. They could be worked in factories. In
order to avoid the possibility of exploiting that type of labor they could
be employed under proper social conditions and placed under the eye of a
neuro-psychiatrist; and where there was an immense shortage of labor, perhaps
factory owners would be pleased to get these men.</p>

<p class='c010'>In other words there is a lot of this defective material which exists
in our society today which has absolutely lost motion, which could be put
to a great deal of use if we were wise enough to do it, if public sentiment
would support us and assist. It is easy to talk of that here. It is
another thing to get public sentiment to help us. There is no longer hospitals
organization than this in the world and perhaps the hundred hospitals
represented here might do something to bring about that public sentiment.
So I am disposed to look at people not from a strictly diagnostic point of
view to look at them from the social point of view as to the possibility of
their becoming useful to a certain degree as social units and the possibility
of society metabolizing them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just one more word. There has been an enormous amount said the last few
years on heredity, and there is a great deal of feeling that there is a
great deal due to heredity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>The study is very interesting,
scientifically very important, but the only attitude we should assume
is to practically throw out of consideration the whole question of
inheritance. If you are going to say this fellow has got a certain disease,
and you are going to conclude it is inherited, that is a fatalistic
diagnosis and the tendency of the diagnosis is to hamstring any effort
that may be made in his behalf. The only way we can find out the percentage
of salvageable material is to endeavor to make the adjustment.
If we put them down as hereditary, our inclination will be to throw them
out of the possibility of consideration. We should rather stress the
possibilities to the utmost and find some solution or partial solution
of a great many of these problems.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>DR. CHRONQUEST (U.S.P.H.S.): So much has been said that I shall not go
on with the problem. I would mention the Compensation side. I have
been wondering for some time, especially among the neuroses, if by our
present system of compensation we are not tending to make crystallized
neuroses. I do not pretend to answer the question. Take, for example,
a chap who has been in the service, who has done good work, whose social
scale has not been high, whose life prior to service has been, as
you might say, from hand to mouth. He has come out of the service with
a definite, known disability acquired by service. By being hospitalized
he has been compensated justly by the Government; he has received the
treatment to which he is entitled; but during the days of his treatment
he has found that he is able to get along more easily under these conditions
than he did prior to service, and decides that one of the best ways
he can make a living is by Compensation. I do not say that that is true
with all, but it is with some of the cases.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have wondered whether or not our present system of compensation to
that type of individual was the best, or whether the system of Canada or
England would be better. In other words, they do not put a premium on
a man to go to a hospital. If I am correct, a man gets less money when
he goes into a hospital than when he is out. It is my meagre opinion
that in that type of neurosis, he would tend to fight harder as an
individual to put himself back into a financial, gainful pursuit; and
with the advantages the Government offers him now, especially through
rehabilitation, I feel he could be put on a much better adjustment than
he was before.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another point which has recently come to the attention of us locally
is the question of guardianship; and I am going to ask Dr. Guthrie if
it is a known fact that two men in the same hospital, with the same
disease—that one will draw his compensation without a guardian, the
other is required to have one.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. GUTHRIE: It was our understanding that a man who is a psychotic by
reason of service should at least have a guardian. If that is not true,
I suggest to the Hospital Committee that it is a point for consideration,
as it puts the man in the field between the devil and the deep, blue sea.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. W. A. WHITE: I think the man who has a guardian has one usually because
his people have applied for such. I believe the Bureau never relinquishes
the right to control of the funds, and is not obliged to pay the funds to
the guardian. Legally the patient can be paid if he is competent.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. CHRONQUEST: In looking over histories of cases that come to West
Roxbury and information received, I believe that a point that would be
of help to the service as a whole is the getting of accurate histories.
We find patients being transferred to N.P. hospitals, who have a diagnosis
which is not correct according to the past histories taken, due
to the fact that careful search has not been made in gathering the facts
of the men’s disabilities. At times it may be the fault of the examining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>physician. It may be the fault of the social service department. Again,
it may be the fault of the individual, or of the family itself in trying
to protect the patient in question. I believe that those errors, which
are seen every once in a while, should be overcome; and I feel that all
of us, whether Neuro-psychiatrists or not, who have anything to do with
either neuroses or psychoses, should be extremely careful of the histories
and get them complete, detailed and accurate.</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL MATTISON: (acting for General Geo. Wood) The Tuberculosis Section
has to deal with a group of patients,—the largest group that the Veterans’
Bureau has to handle. I am sure that we have many men here who
are interested in this subject, and I hope we shall have a very free
discussion of the subject. We shall begin by having each subject opened,
and then the program will be given to general discussion. We shall ask
Dr. Stites to open the session on “The Segregation of Cases”.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON T. H. A. STITES (R) U.S.P.H.S.: This question of segregation of
Tubercular cases is one that has been vexing all of us for a long while.
To understand it at all we have got to review the history of T.B.,—from
the ancient times when T.B. was looked upon as a sort of visitation
from Heaven, and looked upon as a disgrace to the family, on down
to the period when Koch, with his great discovery, found the disease
to be infectious. During that time there came on an organized propaganda
for the control of T.B. upon the ground that any infectious disease is
a preventable disease. This propaganda, as is true of all propaganda,
ran to an extreme. It was so hard for those interested in proving that
T.B. was an infectious disease to impress it upon the public and to
compel them to accept the proposition of its infectiousness, that we
went to the extreme of leading everybody to the idea that it was a virulent
infection; that it was as contagious possibly as some of the acute
infections like scarlatina.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were those who believed that every case should be sent to a
T.B. hospital, absolutely isolated from his family and the world in general.
Then the pendulum began to swing back, and we came to a sensible
conclusion,—that while T.B. is an infectious disease, it is only slightly
so to the adult; and if virulent at all, it is so only among children
and the adolescent. This being so, we had to change from the separate
and isolated hospital for T.B. It has been accepted that every
general hospital should receive its quota of T.B. patients, T.B. being
one of the most common forms of illness, and that in sending out patients
to a strictly T.B. hospital; they should be sent only after the presence
of the disease has been fully well proven.</p>

<p class='c010'>The control of T.B. is after all the big problem before all of us
in T.B. work today. I have often heard it said that any benefit that
comes to the individual is necessarily more or less incidental, and that
the big object we are laboring for is the control of the disease and the
care of the general public health. Be that as it may, the problem that
faces us in the care of the veteran of the World War is the actual care
of the sick.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>The question of prevention of T. B. must be dealt with, first, upon
educational grounds,—to educate the public and the individual to the
point where we can more or less limit the spread of the infection; secondly,
and perhaps more important,—by a campaign for the improved living
conditions of our people in general, especially in childhood.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a matter of fact, when you get right down to it, T.B. is a social
disease; it is a social problem even more than it is a medical problem.
We know that when the good Lord made us, he put into us a certain amount
of quality which, for lack of a better term, we have called natural resistance.
If we can keep that natural resistance at a high point,—build
it up,—the infection, though it may strike us, will not produce
the clinical disease, T.B.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the second place, we come to the actual treatment of the sick.
This, too, is largely a hygienic measure. Since time immemorial, those
interested in T.B. have been searching, have been praying for a specific
cure. Every now and then somebody bobs up with a story of how he is going
to cure T.B. overnight by this or that injection, treatment, etc. In
each of these cases there is a grain of fundamental truth. We have got
to put these things together; and when we get down to the final conclusion
we can not get away from the fact that the treatment of T.B. is the building
up, the bringing back to normal, and in fact if you can, the reaction
to the point beyond the normal, of that quality I spoke of, natural resistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order to accomplish this, I believe one of the most important points
lies in the word, morale; and to encourage your morale, it is wise to get
your classes classified, and to get your T.B. patients working together
in classes in sufficiently large numbers so that you get that inspiration
that comes from what my friend used to speak of as “the psychology of the
crowd.” The thing the soldiers know as the touch of the elbow; there is
a certain magic in it. It is easier to get farther when you know that
somebody besides yourself is going through the same thing. I think we
men in charge of hospitals feel that. That is one of the inspirations that
comes to me from meeting with such a crowd of my fellows here. Away off
there in the swamps of Louisiana there comes a sort of feeling, “We are
here alone; it is hopeless”. When we are all here together exchanging experiences,
there comes the inspiration, “We are not alone”.</p>

<p class='c010'>In your general hospitals you have T.B. beds; have them in sections
by themselves,—not because you are afraid of the spreading of the disease,
not because the T.B. patient is an outcast,—but because you can do more
successful work for the patient, not by segregation, but by classes.</p>

<p class='c010'>In your T.B. sections, have your sub-divisions; have your places to
which you are going to send your ambulatory cases, your far advanced, etc.
Keep them far apart. Use the class system, but be sure that your personnel
is sufficient, so as not to get away from the personal touch.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>Perhaps a little outline of the organization of at least two of the
hospitals with which I am familiar will illustrate my point.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first essential thing when a patient enters a hospital is a
complete examination. Do not let that examination be routine because it
is a T.B. patient. Do not be satisfied with punching the man in the chest
and sticking your ear to his heart. Have somebody who understands neurological
conditions, test his nerve reactions; have someone to test his
mental reactions, as well as the surgical and general medical. Have your
examination ward in which this can be done.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next is your general medical and, possibly, observation ward. I
don’t care how you try to keep observation cases out of T.B. hospitals,—they
are going to get in. If a patient, after being in a month, is
found to be a T.B. case, he is apt to say, “I caught it here”. Put him
where you can answer, “You did not get it here. You have not been in
sufficiently close contact with the disease to catch it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Have your surgical ward; and then your strictly T.B. section.</p>

<p class='c010'>Have first your infirmary or hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>The T.B. man needs special treatment, nursing care and dietetic care.
One of the chief things to give to a T.B. infirmary is good dietetic care;—place
the food before your patient in an appetizing manner; too much
will disgust him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then have your ambulant section and sub-divide it into the section
in which there is clinical activity of the disease, and into the section
in which the clinical condition of the disease is quiescent. By doing
this you can give your people graduated exercises, whatever diets they
may need, periods of rest, and occupational therapy; and you can do it
in an organized, scientific way, and get away from the everlasting complaint,
“You let the fellow in the next bed do it; why won’t you let me
do it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>You have got to study the psychology of your patient. It may be a
little out of the line of segregation of cases. We have heard the talk
here of cases, of hospital management, and all that; but be sure in
dealing with the ex-service man, or any other case, that you do not treat
him merely as a case; that you do not segregate the medical officer in
charge. I find there in the South that one of my life-savers is the fact
that my office door is open to any patient. When I first got to be understood
there was a line-up. I gave an hour every day. Now, since the
patients know that everyone can come to me, I have possibly three or four
in a day. And I don’t do it either by reversing the decisions of my ward
surgeon and my executive officer; I back them up.</p>

<hr class='c040' />

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>DR. KLAUTZ (N.H.D.V.S., Johnson City, Tenn.):</p>

<p class='c010'>The subject of occupation in connection with T.B., is not only an
extremely important one but an extremely difficult one to administer,
particularly in the large government institution, and especially in connection
with the psychology of the ex-service man, which has been referred
to a number of times. He is apt to misunderstand and to be resentful
toward any application of work; and yet at the same time, if
we are going to measure the results of the sanitarium treatment of T.B.
by the functional restoration to activity and usefulness, we still find
that it results in a great many failures. That has been one of the complaints
on the part of T.B. workers not only in government but in civil
institutions as well.</p>

<p class='c010'>We still find relapses occurring after the patient has been discharged
from the sanitarium or T.B. hospital. Men go into training, and in a short
time undergo another course of treatment, and so on. The reason for that
is that they have not been given the necessary physical rehabilitation
while still in the sanitarium, while under institutional protection and
medical supervision.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question of occupation is so broad that it is impossible to take
it up extensively here today. We can point out one or two of the basic
principles in connection with its application in the treatment of T.B.
One very important feature brought out this morning is the psychotherapeutic
object,—the point of view of relaxation or recreation,
that is, giving the man something to occupy his mind and improve his morale,
helping him to forget his home anxieties and anxiety about compensation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second point, or 2 A, deals with muscular reconstruction,—conversion
of recently acquired adipose tissue into working force by rebuilding
flabby muscular tissue which has resulted from the long period
of rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>2 A is the acquiring of a tolerance for T.B, toxins. This is important.
We do know that in the recently toxic stage, exercise or work
does produce a reaction which is shown by a rise in pulse rate. We know
that if exercise is begun in small doses and gradually increased, the time
will come when the patient can be made to take a fairly large amount of
exercise continuing over a fairly long period of time, without manifesting
the symptoms of reaction. Formerly we gave Tuberculin in gradual
doses until we reached the point where the man could take an injection
which surely would have killed him at the beginning of the course. The
main point is if a man leaves the sanitarium before he reaches this toxin
tolerance, he is more likely to break down. This is the reason for the
man’s frequently returning to the sanitarium for treatment.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>The third point deals with applying occupation as a means of training
or retraining the man for some new occupation or modification of his
former occupation; and here is where a great deal of judgment and study
of the individual case becomes necessary. It is very difficult to find
out just what is the best kind of work for the man from a physical and
mental point of view; but the important thing is to have the man try it
out and test it, and begin this physical reconstruction and rehabilitation
if we are to get permanent results from sanitarium treatment. I
don’t believe we have solved the problem completely, and I believe other
agencies will have to be called in.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this connection the question of dispensary work and social and
nursing follow-up work is going to be extremely important. The man who
leaves an institution ought to be followed up very carefully, and effort
should be made to bring him back to some medical unit for re-examination
at least every two months in order to see if there is any relapse of
the former activity.</p>

<p class='c018'>SENIOR SURGEON R. H. STANLEY, USPHS (R): It is always interesting of course,
to be told what we ought to do and how to do it, but it seems to me it
would be a great deal more interesting to take the little time we have
this afternoon and discuss some of our real problems, and I mean by that
problems that we as commanding officers of the hospitals have to contend
with every day. I know and you know there are thousands of little things
come up upon which we would like to have advice. There are many problems
I might be able to solve readily; there are others you would be able to
solve. I believe it would be worth more to tell how to get rid of some
of these problems.</p>

<p class='c010'>I believe that the success of running a hospital rests entirely
upon the confidence that your patients have in you. If you are sincere
they know it, and when they know that they will do anything for you. If
you are not sincere they are going to know it mighty quick and you are
going to have trouble. If you tell the men you are with them, that you
are going to be 50–50 with them, if you call them in and talk to them
as you would to a son, and if you let them see you are not doing it because
of a matter of necessity, you can get by without writing petitions
into Washington.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found the other day a petition had gone to Washington from my
hospital. It was necessary to discharge two men for drinking. It was
their first offense. They came to me and said, “You have not treated us
fair because it is our first offense.” Just before I left my station I
received a letter which was addressed to these men by Colonel Forbes. In
that letter he said “I have received your petition signed by 27 patients
and asking that the hospital be investigated on account of a few patients
being discharged for drinking. I wish to state for your benefit that I
have given the matter consideration and I am standing right behind the
medical officer in charge.” Leaving out the names, I had copies made of
those letters and placed one of them on the bulletin board of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>When I went out to Whipple Barracks there had been some little
disturbance there among the men. They were dissatisfied in various
ways and it seemed like a big problem how to handle these men. When I
once had their confidence I handled them.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have found this in my experience, that I have never been able to
have a satisfied personnel unless I give them the best I can. So long as
you feed them well you will not have much trouble, because that will
keep up the morale better than any other one thing I know. If you will
feed them, be honest with them, be fair, you will have very little
trouble in running the hospital.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON J. F. WALLACE, USPHS (R): The subject of entertainment probably
would cover the subject of recreation at hospitals. It is rather hard
for me to describe what recreation should be given at a tuberculous
hospital because it depends on the location of the hospital. At the
hospital at Fort Stanton where I am located we do not have any entertainment.
If any social workers come down there I will be glad to entertain
them, because we have only three visitors a year down there. That is
one of the things in which I would compare our institution with some of
these other institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>For many years I have been connected with a large sanitorium where
we had strict discipline and little entertainment. The patients were
satisfied. Our average stay of patients is six months. In looking over
your sanitoriums you don’t find many patients staying six months.</p>

<p class='c010'>When I was in the Army I was in one of the largest t.b. sanitoriums
of the country. They sent back hundreds of men to this hospital and
people came out and entertained them. They were entertained every night
by the Red Cross with moving pictures, they were entertained in the
afternoons by a local organization; they were entertained to death. These
men afterwards got out and were not satisfied unless they were placed in
an institution which was a social center. After I went out I was Chief
of the Eleventh t. b. district of Denver. I noticed that the men who were
treated at Fort Lyon were a better class to handle because they were not
so much entertained. Once in a while I would talk to some of these men
and ask them if they wanted to get well, as I could tell them a place to
go and frequently I used to send them to Fort Stanton where they could
not be entertained and they could get well.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you have ever lived in an isolated place, you can appreciate it.
My wife and I had pioneered this sanitorium together for quite a while.
Once in a while we used to go to Denver and we could enjoy any show they
had in Denver, even the 10–cent and 20–cent ones. I have heard men criticize
entertainments at Fitzsimmons; they would swear and walk out while
Madame Schumann-Heinck was singing, because they were dissatisfied; they
were saturated with entertainment. I am against entertainment for tuberculous
patients only in a very mild degree. We have one picture show a
week and they enjoy that picture show. We have only Sunday School Sunday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>morning. The minister will bring in a few amateur singers and the boys
think they are wonderful; they are wonderful; and they will all sing.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have some fifty War Risk patients at my Sanitorium. I have known
them for three years. I know them all by name. They were kicked out from
Sanitorium to Sanitorium. They came down to Stanton. I went there on
the first of July and no man has asked for his transfer or discharge.
I suppose there is less turn-over of t.b. patients at any place than at
Fort Stanton, where there is no entertainment. These men can go anywhere.
We have a 30,000 or 40,000 acre farm. We try to get these men
interested in the different things in the Sanitorium. On Christmas
we let the men arrange the Christmas trees. They amuse themselves down
there. The men trap quite a number of wild animals, bob cats, etc. and
they are interested in the place we have, which is close to nature. You
would be surprised how little amusement you need for entertainment if
you get away from it. You have got to control these men and direct them
every minute in the day. You have got to give them a task. Have their
hours for rest; their hours for exercise. It is up to you who are
running Sanitoriums to entertain your men. You might lecture to them;
that is entertainment; but don’t have them twice a week or three times
a week. Once in a great while the men are interested in the study of
their disease. Don’t speak to them in scientific terms, let them understand
the disease. They say in the curing of tuberculosis it depends
more upon what a man has from his neck up than what he has from the
neck down. Impress upon them that they have got to live a careful life.
Keep people out who want to entertain them. Your men will be just as
well and better satisfied with little entertainment if you keep them
busy all day long.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. SMITH, U.S.P.H.S.: I wanted to discuss this afternoon a matter which
is of great concern to all branches of the service, and that is Order
59 as applied to transfers from hospital to hospital. Order 59 is going
to be watched rather carefully by the Veterans’ Bureau. Order 59 lists
hospitals and gives a certain number of hospitals to each district. A
district manager in New York may take a tuberculous patient and send
him to a local hospital or he may send him away to a certain designated
hospital to which he has blanket authority to send him, Oteen or Fitzsimmons;
but according to Order 59, once they send a man to a local
hospital, the district manager may not remove the man from that hospital
and send the man to Fitzsimmons Hospital in Denver. In other words, it
is worth watching to see whether Order 59 will not rather tempt the
district managers to make a snap diagnosis on the ground and send away
to the hospital to which he has blanket authorization to make transfers,
on the one hand, a man whose disease is so far advanced, that it might
be unwise to send him; or, on the other hand, men with questionable
diagnosis. It will be worth watching. I am sure the Veterans’ Bureau
will desire information on the subject as to whether you who are out in
the tuberculous hospitals will receive classes of patients who are unsuitable
in the usual sense of the word for transfer.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>Here is another thing we shall all need to watch and concerning
which the Veterans’ Bureau will I know desire information. Will the
practice of sending patients to the local general hospitals result in
a piling up of patients who need to be transferred and whose transfers
will be delayed. We all know that a transfer is indicated not only for
the purpose of providing a climatic change and we all know that in certain
sections of the country there are provided beds for tuberculous patients
and it is necessary to keep these beds filled.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to the present practice and strict interpretation of
order 59, if the medical officer in charge of the Naval Hospital in
New York has a tuberculous patient and wants to effect his discharge to
Fitzsimmons, he first asks the district manager for permission to transfer
the patient. The district manager in turn asks the Director of the
Veterans’ Bureau; the Director of the Veterans’ Bureau advises the district
manager, who in turn advises the officer in charge of the Navy Hospital.
Now it will be necessary to watch and see whether this effects
an undesirable delay in making the transfers. The Veterans’ Bureau will
desire to be informed if such is the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another thing. A patient under treatment at Fort Bayard,
New Mexico, and fit for discharge cannot, according to a strict interpretation
of Order 59 be discharged without invoking the same authorities
who sent him there. In other words, he must take it up with the district
manager, who then advises the man in charge of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>Order 59 is magnificent in this, if it works out: that no man will
be transferred from one hospital to another except upon the recommendation
of the medical officer in charge, and you who have had experience
in this matter will know what that means. It means that it is not the
man with the longest and strongest pull who will be transferred but the
man whose transfer is recommended by the officer in charge of the hospital.
We are prepared to assist in every possible way in carrying out that order
but it is necessary for us to watch the effect from the field and get
advices from all hospitals concerned, as to whether this order will not
need modification.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON F. H. MCKEON, USPHS: Some have stated that they were in ignorance
of the existence of G. O. 27. At Hospital # 64, upon the receipt of
that order we immediately had about one hundred copies made and the
entire hospital personnel was supplied therewith. After that every man
upon admission was furnished with a copy, together with a copy of the
rules of the hospital, for which he signed a receipt. I offer that as a
suggestion.</p>

<p class='c010'>On Tuesday the statement was made here that a man who is able to
take five or six hours prevocational training at a hospital has no
place in a hospital and should be in training. I think that statement
should be qualified somewhat. It may easily happen that a man who can
safely take five or six hours prevocational training in a hospital would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>soon break down under vocational training, for the reason that while he
is in hospital his entire life is supervised; he must take a rest hour;
he must turn in at a given time at night; he is assured of three or possibly
more proper meals a day. Those conditions do not obtain when that
man becomes a trainee and I sincerely hope that the follow-up nursing
system which the Veterans’ Bureau is putting into effect now will result
in a more careful supervision of the trainee’s life, so that when it is
found he is living not wisely but too well he may be given proper advice
and be returned to the hospital before the breakdown occurs.</p>

<p class='c010'>This afternoon the subject of hospitalizing the tuberculous veteran
in n. p. hospitals was discussed. I rather think it a somewhat sweeping
assertion to say that every tuberculous individual with mental symptoms
should be hospitalized in a t. b. sanitorium. We will all grant that men
with signs and symptoms of an active tuberculosis disease should be hospitalized
in an institution for the treatment of tuberculous. But to
my mind that does not hold where the disability is clearly a mental disorder;
that man is ambulant. The other man gives no trouble whatever
because he is bed-ridden. I have no doubt that every t. b. hospital
commander here today has had such cases. Your ambulant case, with few
if any indications of active tuberculosis but who notwithstanding is
tubercular, when he develops mental symptoms is not only a source of annoyance
in the tuberculosis hospital but is destructive of morale. His
place is clearly in a hospital for the treatment of mental cases.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. M. C. GUTHRIE, U. S. VETERANS’ BUREAU: This matter affects us administratively
from a different angle. Many of the general hospitals have
wards for the cure of tuberculosis. We presume that the turn-over must
be fairly rapid. When men have accumulated in sufficient number and
their disposition is determined as to whether they should go to a tuberculous
institution, and they refuse to go, shall we turn them out or
shall we let them stay?</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON L. M. WILBUR, USPHS: If the transfer is suggested in the interest
of the physical welfare of the patient and he refuses to accept that
transfer, he is interfering with treatment. The regulations provide for
that.</p>

<p class='c018'>SENIOR SURGEON T. R. PAYNE, USPHS: I don’t agree with some of the t. b.
men. I think a man can make a fight if he is dissatisfied and does not
want to go and I think you will do harm in transferring him. If a man
is home-sick and will not improve, I think he will do very much better
to stay just where he is and you ought not force that man to go somewhere
where he will not be satisfied. A sanatorium is a school to teach men
how to live. In a general hospital you will have trouble in enforcing
a rest hour because there are a great many other men in the institution
who are not compelled to do so. The pass privilege is another thing. Some
patients have but one pass a week and other patients get passes frequently.
It serves to dissatisfy the t. b. men as they felt they were not on
an equal footing. That is the only objection I can see.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>SENIOR SURGEON J. E. DEDMAN, USPHS (R): There are several things that
occur to me. In the first place there is the question of food. Of
course that is the vital thing in every hospital. In our hospital,
as I said before, we have a large number of negroes and what you give
to the white boys in the north is not satisfactory to the colored patient.
I think it is an important thing to try to give the men what they want
in the way of food.</p>

<p class='c010'>When I went to Greenville it was the custom to give the men breakfast
at about seven o’clock; luncheon at 10:30; noon meal at 12 o’clock;
at noon the men were not hungry and were generally dissatisfied with the
food; at 3 o’clock, after the rest hour, they would have another nourishment;
supper was served at five o’clock and as a rule they did not care
much for that. Then we would send over to the wards large quantities of
milk and eggs and bread and butter. They did not need any base balls.
They played ball with apples.</p>

<p class='c010'>It occurred to me that that was a bad system. We omitted the
morning nourishment and the afternoon nourishment and I substituted an
evening cafeteria luncheon thinking that it was a long gap from the
supper at five o’clock to breakfast at 7. We thereby saved a great deal
of money and since we did that we find the patients think the food is
fine. We also find that they sleep better by taking this light luncheon
just before they retire. I mention that for what it is worth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rest hour is important in tuberculosis. That is why hospitalization
is so essential, because men will not take proper rest. We have
a morning rest from 9 to 10, afternoon rest from 1 to 3 and evening rest
from 6 to 6:45. The last period is not universal, and we wonder how
you can get an accurate record of a man’s condition when you do not
get his evening temperature. We find that it has been a great help to
us. When I instituted this rest period from 6 to 6:45 I told the men
it was for their good and although they objected at first, it appealed
to their reason, after they were told why it was done, and we have had
no trouble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another thing we have inaugurated along this line. I talked with
Dr. Smith last spring. He agreed to send to our hospital a school for
chiefs. I think this was a most helpful thing, because we had chiefs
of medical staffs come to us and take a course that would tend to make
for uniformity in administrative medical work in our tuberculous hospitals.
I have talked since that time with several of the men who came
down to take that course and I believe every one of them expressed the
opinion that it was very helpful to him to have an opportunity to exchange
ideas and to have the same methods for carrying of medical staff work
which required tact and executive ability.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one thing I could not pass by because it is of such great
importance to the Federal Employees Compensation Commission. We have
sometimes employees engaged along various lines, and shortly after I arrived
at the station I found one or two who said they had tuberculosis. I
think it is most essential to see that not only one man but a board of
medical officers examine every employee when he comes into a tuberculous
hospital to make sure that he does not show activity in tuberculosis so
that later he will not have a claim against the Federal Employees Compensation
Commission by saying that he was working in a tuberculosis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>hospital and contracted tuberculosis while in the hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are many things I would like to speak of. I was very much
impressed with what the doctor said about entertainment. I believe it
helps the morale and is the most wonderful thing in the world. We can
spend sleepless nights building up morale in a hospital and one man can
disturb the entire morale.</p>

<p class='c010'>In closing I want to say, after all is said and done, the big
thing with us is the backing we get from the heads of our department and
from the Surgeon General. I have known times I felt like throwing up
the sponge. All of us have gone through these moments. The main and
only thing that keeps us up is the encouragement we get from the heads
of the department and I want to take this opportunity to express my
appreciation.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: This meeting was called for the week of the 20th, with the
understanding of the Budget Director, General Dawes, that on tomorrow
the Chiefs of the various Departments of the Government were to hold
their semi-annual session and we thought that you would enjoy that
occasion. It has been found impossible in the compilation of the facts
and figures necessary to hold that meeting tomorrow. Therefore
it becomes necessary for us to change our program and I am happy
to announce to you that I feel sure you will have quite as interesting
a program as you would have otherwise, for tomorrow we will have as the
first speaker of the morning, Congressman Madden, the head of the Appropriations
Committee. If you have not heard him I am sure you will be
very much interested both in what he has to say and in the way he says
it. We are then to have as the next speaker of the morning, General
Dawes. General Dawes is remaining over tomorrow that he may have the
pleasure of meeting you personally, and I predict that you will agree,
after you have heard General Dawes, that if you have had no other excuse
or no other compensation in coming to this meeting, you will have
it in hearing General Dawes. For the balance of the program of tomorrow
forenoon, it comes to my mind that possibly it would be most interesting
to you all if we were to take up some of the questions that come to
your mind that have not been presented in this program. This was suggested
to me by one of the gentlemen here who I noticed does not talk much but
who evidently thinks a lot, that it would be to the interest of a good
many if they might bring up some subject that they are particularly interested
in. So we are going to have in the morning a question box, and
if any of you have questions in which you are particularly interested and
will present them at the desk of the Secretary, we shall try to have them
taken up for discussion at this round-table hour tomorrow forenoon.</p>

<p class='c010'>President Harding will not be here in the morning. When I spoke to
President Harding to come over and address this meeting, he said to me,
“General, you know Mrs. Harding and I are to receive this body tomorrow
evening.” I am sure that you are going to have in that reception, in the
personal contact with the President and Mrs. Harding, a joy such as you
have not contemplated.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: Fellows of the conference, as I told you yesterday we
had expected this morning to be here with the Chiefs of the Bureaus. I
explained to you why that program was changed. I told you also that
you would not be disappointed in today’s program, and now I am going to
prove it.</p>

<p class='c010'>America produces many things. It is wonderful in agriculture, in
industry, in commerce, but one of the greatest products of America is
its men, and, strange as it may seem if you will stop to study it from
that aspect, you will find that each State of the Union has its record
for producing certain kinds of men. For instance, from Wyoming we get
our stock men; from Iowa, our farmers; from Indiana, our authors, particularly
our fiction writers; from Ohio, of course, we get our presidents;
from Illinois, a thousand miles from Wall Street, we get the
greatest of financiers. It is true that Illinois has produced more
financiers than any other State, and men who have been at the head of
the greatest banking institutions of the United States have come from
this great corn-raising, middle-western State.</p>

<p class='c010'>I should like to remind you, before I introduce this speaker, that
this Federal Board of Hospitalization represented last year an expenditure,
in all of their various lines of work, of $750,000,000.00.
We have in our employ this morning something like 42,000 individuals,
for which it is costing us something like $42,000,000. Today we are
providing 132,000 meals for the people in the government hospitals and
the employees that are necessary to take care of them. Tonight, if this
northern blizzard continues, it will require 132,000 blankets to cover
them; and in the most economical way in which we can provide for the
needs of these sick men it will cost us—it does cost us—in round
numbers, a hundred thousand dollars each day, with institutions operated
as economically as they can be.</p>

<p class='c010'>I only relate this that all of you may know and may carry this message
to the country—that Uncle Sam is certainly not stingy; that Uncle
Sam is really putting forth every energy he possibly can to carry out
the idea of the best treatment of the World War Veteran.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is my story in brief.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have pleasure now in introducing to you Congressman Madden, Chairman
of the Appropriations Committee of the House.</p>

<p class='c018'>CONGRESSMAN MADDEN:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:</p>

<p class='c010'>The most sacred obligation we have today imposed upon the Government
is the proper care of the men who came back from the War less
physically fit than they were when they went away. Provision is being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_702'>702</span>made for their care to the extent that it is possible to make it. I
think it may be safe to say that no country in all the world has been
so generous in its care of its wounded soldiers, as America.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hospitalization is one thing that we must provide, and we must
provide every necessary comfort for those who gave to the country in its
hour of direct need. We must not be foolish, however, in what we do.
We must have a care as weal of other things as of the men themselves.
I think the American people would be willing to make any sacrifice for
the comfort of the men who served the nation either in the late war
or any other war; and the best evidence of their willingness to do that
and of the willingness of the Congress to cooperate is the fact that
we are spending out of the public treasury for the allotments, allowances,
hospitalization, vocational training, insurance, and other
things for the comfort of these men, 489 million dollars a year; and
it is growing and, as far as I can see, it will continue to grow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now we may be doing some things in connection with this expenditure
that are not for the best interests of the men, and I sometimes
have doubt as to whether we are wise or unwise. I sometimes have doubt
as to whether we are managing this expenditure as it ought to be managed,—whether
we are giving the proper care to the moral situation
surrounding the hospitals where these men are being treated. We have
evidence before my committee in the record testified to by those in
charge of hospitals in which these men are being cared for, to show
the most demoralizing situation as the result of the extravagance and
expenditure of money by the men being hospitalized at the expense of the
Government.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have a suggestion to make in this connection. I have no desire
whatsoever to take away from any man anything that ought to be given to
him in the way of service or care by the Government. On the contrary,
no man will go as far as I will to see that proper care and proper
attention is given to every man that served the nation; but I believe
that in the payments we make to these men who are being hospitalized,
we ought to have some control over where that money goes, while they
are in the hospital. (APPLAUSE).</p>

<p class='c010'>I would suggest two thoughts, either the thought that while they
are in the hospital they must deposit their money with those in charge,
and be allowed to expend only a limited sum, and thereby prevent the
assemblage in the neighborhood of the institution which the Government
of the United States is maintaining for the care of its patriotic men,
from becoming the nest of demoralization or prostitution. You can’t
make it too strong. The facts disclose the situation. Now, we have
an obligation greater than the obligation to care for the man, and that
is to see that while we are caring for them we do not destroy them.
(<em class='gesperrt'>APPLAUSE</em>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_703'>703</span>We have got to have the courage to adopt a plan.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the present moment most men connected with the government
service have been afraid to express an opinion in connection with the
ex-service men, lest somebody might become offended at his attitude.
(APPLAUSE) Now I am not one of these men. I believe the time has come
when the man in public office has got to have the courage of his convictions;
there is nobody in the world that people hate so much as the
man in high public place who has not the courage of his convictions.
The man in high public place has got to have sufficient courage to protect
the rank and file of those who are being protected by the Government
from the folly of their own deeds; and that applies as well to the
Legion and all other organizations connected with the ex-service men, as well
as anybody else, for it can.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now we have a two-fold obligation,—I may say three-fold. We
have the obligation to the men, to give them proper care. We have the
obligation to the Treasury to see that that care is not conducted at an
outrageous expense; and we have the obligation to the Nation to see that
the moral standpoint of the communities in which these men are being
cared for, is not degraded as a result of our attempt to help the men;
and the only way you can stop that is to prevent the men while in the
care of the Government, from having unlimited right to spend the money
allotted to them out of the Treasury of the United States. It would
be far better for them, far better for the community, for the nation,
far better for the future of all if we could arbitrarily take the money
away from them while they are in our control; place it on deposit, and
see that it is applied for some useful purpose for their families after
they leave our care. We can do it. We have the power. Have we the
courage? I think we have, and if you will join me, we will do it!
(<em class='gesperrt'>APPLAUSE</em>)</p>

<p class='c010'>I think the men themselves will be happier. Their organizations
will be more pleased. You will have some grumbling, but you will have
it anyhow. Far better to have the grumbling when the men are sober than
otherwise. Far better to have the grumbling when men are likely to be
contented than when they are discontented; and I don’t know of any
individual more happy than he who knows that when we get through with
the treatment we are giving him he can look forward to having a bank
account somewhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>You know we are liable to destroy the usefulness of this man.
The citizenship of the future may depend upon our actions, and we must
be careful. The obligation is ours today; it must be somebody else’s
tomorrow; but the transfer of obligation from one man to another ought
not to make any difference. Any man afraid of the obligation to do this
work ought to be transferred, because he is not fit for his job. Public
office is just an opportunity to serve; that is all. The man who is in
public office, who trims his sails to meet every passing wind is not
fit for the job. He must have courage, integrity, purpose in life; and
the man who cannot do the things that are dictated by conscience and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>right in a great public office ought not to be returned to it. The
man that cannot feel the consciousness of his own rectitude, but
rather the political bee buzzing, is not fit for a public office; and
the men who are in the great service in which you men are employed
have obligations, wonderful obligations, wonderful opportunities.</p>

<p class='c010'>We depend upon you for the outline of the plan that we must
follow in our treatment of this great army of patriotic men that have
come back, eyeless, legless, armless, and sick in many other ways; but
we must also depend upon you to cooperate with us in an effort to prevent
the looting of the public Treasury and the reduction of the moral
standpoint of the nation.</p>

<p class='c010'>You need not be afraid to suggest. We should like to have your
suggestions. We invite them; we welcome then. You need not be afraid
to criticize; we are glad to have that. But we want you not only to
remember that money is a factor as well as a help, but we want you to
learn how to spend money. Most doctors do not know how, especially Army
doctors. I have discovered that. I don’t blame them. Their minds run
along other lines, but somebody has to watch this side of the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now one thing we ought to remember is that the estimates for the
expenses of the Government of the United States for the fiscal year,
1923, sent to the Congress amount to 167 million dollars more than we
have got; and since these estimates came, 50, 60, 70 million dollars
more have come, adding that much more to that which we have not got.
I just want to say to you, gentlemen, right here that it does not make
any difference how many estimates come, there won’t be a bit appropriated
beyond the revenue, and I don’t care from whom the estimates come.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our job is to represent the tax-payers. Somebody must visualize
the nation. You men visualize the thing before you; you see the local
picture. We see more than that; we see the whole picture; and our job
is not only to see that the rights of those under our care are protected
and preserved, but that the rights of the people who are not
under our care and under whose care we are, are protected. We represent
the tax-payers of the nation. They have been mighty patriotic;
they have been liberal; they have not grumbled; they have paid the
price; they have paid it with courage; and they have shown their
patriotism. They have shown their unselfish devotion to liberty. They
are willing to meet any expense that may be imposed for the proper care
of those who fell before the bullets of the enemy; but they want and
will insist upon proper supervision of the expenditures.</p>

<p class='c010'>They have a right to that. They have a right to relief from the
burdens of taxation to the extent that we can help to give them that
relief; and it is your job and mine and that of every other man
in the government service,—whether he be a dollar-a-year man or
whether he be given fifty thousand dollars a year for the privilege of
service,—to do everything in his power to make the people of America
feel that they are not misrepresented in anything we may do.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_705'>705</span>The expenses of the Government for 1919 were nineteen billions;
for 1920, seven billion, five hundred; for 1921, six billion, five hundred;
for 1922, four billion, thirty-four millions; but a billion, eight
hundred and forty-five millions of that are in three fixed charges, i.e.,
nine hundred and seventy-five million dollars a year for interest on the
public debt, which did not exist before the war; three hundred and
eighty-one million dollars a year for the sinking-fund, which did not
exist before the war; four hundred and eighty-nine million dollars a year
for the care of the men that you are here to represent, for their hospitalization,
allotments, allowances, insurance, and so on; so that we
have that fixed charge in these three items that never existed before.
Our Government in the future is bound to cost twice what it ever cost
before, and so we have everybody in the United States watching every
dollar of expenditure.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have seven million tax-payers now that pay out of their incomes,—seven
million people watching what we do. Before the war we
did not have any of these people. They did not care what you did;
how much money you spent, or where you got it. They did not have to
pay it; it was not being paid directly. Now it is paid direct, and
the more tax-payers you have got paying into the Treasury, the more
account you have got to have of what you do with the government funds.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am just here today to say to you, gentlemen, that I know you
can help a lot both in effecting economy of expenditure and in creating
a better condition, from the moral standpoint, in all of the surroundings
where our men are being treated and cared for. You can cooperate
by suggesting to our Committee on Appropriations how we can best meet
the situation that will prevent extravagant waste of money by the men
who are being cared for, while they are in the institutions, and how we
can preserve the funds for them and their families; also, how we can preserve
the moral standards of the institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why, the statements that come to me are appalling about the low
moral standards around some of these institutions. I heard a good deal
about the Army camps during the war, but it was not any worse than now.
It is for you men to say what we shall do to prevent it, and we want you
to cooperate fairly, loyally, actively, unitedly and promptly, because
we must at any hazard and at any cost prevent any condition that will
bring stench to the institution that we are trying to preserve.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must not under any circumstances allow the fund that is
being used to preserve the health to the limit and build up the men who
served us during the war, to be used for any purpose that will create
scandal in the nation; and it is bound to create scandal if we do not
watch out for the moral standard in every community.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, pave the way. Show us how we can tie the fund up, and
help us to help the people of the nation to preserve the men who are
the wards of the nation. We must not demoralize them; we must not
make them mendicants; we must not encourage them to leave their normal,
legitimate employment to become wards of the nation; but we must encourage
these men in every way that we can to become so useful that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_706'>706</span>will be able to help themselves and be willing to do it, and not depend
upon the nation.</p>

<p class='c010'>If I have been able to express a thought at all here that will
be of any value in the long run, I shall feel well repaid for having
come. I know of no more patriotic men than those who confront me, and
no more patriotic women than those who devoted themselves to the service
of the nation during the war. There are no more patriotic men and
women than these anywhere. They made the sacrifice during the darkest
hours. Many of you men could go out and, as far as dollars go, be much
better off; but you prefer to do a service to the nation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, couple with your medical service the two suggestions that
I made. Let me repeat them,—the up-building of the moral standard,
and the maintenance of an economic expenditure of the funds that may
be placed under your charge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thank You.”</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: “Fellows, as an expression of your appreciation of
the presence of Congressman Madden this morning, I would ask you
to rise to your feet, that he may know we believe in him and are
for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The assembly responded by standing up.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: I would lose a great opportunity if I did not take
advantage of this particular moment to say to you that I should
like—being a doctor myself—that we relieve ourselves of the
charge of not being business men. Certainly in the administration
of year affairs you have the greatest opportunity that can
come to men now to demonstrate that you have some business sense
as well as professional sense, and to me it is a great pleasure
to have this program this morning because it gives us a new idea
of what it means to think in the language of dollars and cents.</p>

<p class='c010'>This administration has great ambitions to develop within
the Government a business organization. The President of the
United States believes that the machinery conducting the affairs
of the Government of the United States is about as complete, is
about as capable as any machinery that could possibly be devised,
providing it has a perfect system of organization and business
operation of these affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The experiences of the past have shown that we have
gone on in our governmental affairs without due regard to where
we were to get out. We have depended upon deficiency bills to
help us in our extravagance or our over-expenditures. The time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_707'>707</span>has come when that policy is a matter of the past.</p>

<p class='c010'>Realizing that it was only possible to carry on the affairs
of our Government along business lines, the President sought what
he regards—and I know this personally because I have heard him
express it many times—one of the biggest and best and most potent
business men of the United States of America to take charge of
the direction of the budget; and I now have great pleasure in introducing
to you, follows, my dearest, closest friend, General
Charles G. Dawes, of Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_708'>708</span>“Mr. Chairman and Members of the Conference:</p>

<p class='c010'>The trouble with most of the Government meetings is that
they do not assume the nature of a business meeting. We have
something that is entirely different from the atmosphere which
surrounds the meeting of any private business organization.</p>

<p class='c010'>In my work down here for this year, I look upon the Government
simply as a business organization and unless I get
formality out of my mind, I do not get close to the people with
whom I do business. So this morning I just simply want to explain—because
when you can give the reasons for the imposition
of discipline and rules of action, you make these rules of action
doubly effective.</p>

<p class='c010'>I want to explain, and grasp this opportunity to explain
something of the working of the machinery which has been set in
motion by the President, creating by Executive Order for
the first time, a machine for the imposition of an Executive plan,
and a pressure upon Governmental business. In other words, the
President, for the first time, has assumed his responsibility as
business head of the organization. He has established certain
agencies for the imposition of executive policies and I wanted to
explain  something about them.</p>

<p class='c010'>This meeting, itself, is the result of the creation of
one of these coordinating agencies by Executive Order. And what
is involved in this meeting?</p>

<p class='c010'>Suppose a private corporation was spending, apart from
the interest it paid on its debts, about one-fourth of all its
expenditures along one certain line of activity. That is what
this Government is doing through the Boards represented here,—Army,
Navy, Veterans’ Bureau, etc. Supposing that business had
run along for a hundred years and somebody would come in and say
to the head of the business, “How much money are you spending on
this particular activity?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, so much, one-fourth of all we spend.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you ever had a meeting of the heads of the agencies
for the expenditure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, how do you know you are not duplicating facilities?
How do you know there is any coordination between the establishments
you are building in the securing of supplies, in
the hiring of men?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We don’t know. We never have had, in this business organization,
even a meeting to discuss the question of proper expenditure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_709'>709</span>of money upon the standpoint of one corporation as distinguished
from five separate departments of a corporation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now what a ridiculous situation that is and yet that
is what has pertained from the beginning of Government. We have
forty-one independent governmental departments and establishments
and each of them has been going on its own way and the result has
been chaos in business, absolute chaos. It is a remarkable thing
that here for the first time in the history of the Government you
have got together the elements to determine the proper administration
of this most important matter of the care of the sick and the disabled
among the veterans of the war. For the first time it is possible,
by this juxtaposition, to properly consider policies to prevent
duplication, to devise ways and means and it is a comment upon the
terrible conditions under which the business of this Government has
been transacted, and that is the first instance where you could get
them all together to discuss a coordinated policy. That has been so
with everything. The meeting never would have gotten together,
you never could have gotten together physically in connection with
this thing unless you had been ordered together by the use of the
Executive power of the President of the United States. Now don’t
get that out of your head,—that underneath this reorganization of
government, which is not to be effected, but which has been effected
in this routine business, there is the idea of force, and if the idea
of force was not there we would not have gotten anywhere in connection
with the securing of these results, which small as they are, represent
an immense advance upon the old situation. I speak now from the
standpoint of the accomplishment of these coordinating boards,—not as
predicting something that is going to be done, but of the result of
that which has been done during the last six months through coordinating
agencies such as your Federal Board, established by the President
of the United States through the use of his authority and running the
routine business of the Government for the first time upon a business
basis.</p>

<p class='c010'>I make this distinction (for Mr. Burke, for instance) as
some misapprehension may be had in connection with this matter of
policy. The Budget Bureau, is not concerned with policy save that of
economy and efficiency. We are concerned with the routine expenditure
of money, of proper conduct of routine business. It is our business
to see that when money is appropriated by Congress along a certain
line or policy with which we have nothing to do, that that money is
spent as economically and as judiciously and carefully as possible in
order to secure the greatest results along the line of the policy
imposed by Congress.</p>

<p class='c010'>If Congress as a matter of policy should pass a law to put
garbage on the White House steps, it becomes our duty, regrettable as
it might be, to advise Congress and the Executive as to how the largest
amount of garbage may be most expeditiously and economically spread on the
White House steps. And that is why we are safe in demanding what is
absolutely necessary, in every business, in routine matters,—a centralized
authority. There is no democracy in a properly organized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_710'>710</span>business so far as routine business is concerned. It is a monarchy,
and if the sense of responsibility on the part of the agent to the man
at the head of the corporation, who is responsible for the policy, is
lost, the business goes to pieces, and, if a private business, you go
into the hands of the sheriff.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trouble is that in the past the Presidents of the United
States have not done their full duty and assumed the control of the
routine business organization of Government. The result is, as is always
the case, with a private or public organization, that when the money is
spent by parties interested alone in spending the money, the plan of the
unit over which the spending head presides takes precedence over the
plan of the organization as a whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now that has been exactly the situation in the United States
up to this time, and in dollars and cents, to say nothing of the matter
of the use of facilities, there has been a waste that is incalculable
in the past.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, for instance, take this. All this is preliminary but it
is very important. Let me talk about human nature in connection with
this matter of taking order,—this matter of jealousy of prerogative.
I sometimes think we ought all to take a course of study in human nature.
I sometimes think that while in the A. E. F. charged by the Commander-in-Chief
with this same job of coordinating separated services, the independent
services of the Army in connection with the unified business
plan of the A. E. F., and afterwards in trying to couple up the allies
in the same line of endeavor, I had a better chance than most people to
see in its full majesty,—if you choose to look at it that way—that
desire for absolute independence,—that willingness to subordinate
practically everything on earth to hold power which is characteristic of
human nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>When you have to approach independent power, to induce voluntary
surrender, I have found you might as well give it up in advance.
There is nothing a man holds to like this right to exercise power, and
the best illustration of that is shown by the fact that the greatest war
of all ages was fought for four years without a central command.
Napoleon’s 44th maxim in war was that nothing is more important
in war than a unified command, under one chief. Everybody knew it, but
it was not until the unnecessary loss of hundreds of thousands of lives
and billions of dollars worth of material that Great Britain bent its
pride and accepted that plain, common-sense provision of unified command
of the allies under Foch. Not until the fourth year of the war when the
allied cause faced annihilation was such a plain, common-sense provision
as that for central command possible to be made for the allies, and
the certainty of annihilation alone made it possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now do you think it is any different in connection with the
independent jurisdiction of these Government Departments, from the independent
services of the Army?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_711'>711</span>They talked in the past about Interdepartmental Boards, to correct
this old chaos, when they had no Executive leadership. An effort
was made from time to time by Interdepartmental Boards, acting as a committee
without relinquishment of the independent authority represented
to undertake some of these reforms, the necessity of which everybody saw.
Nothing was ever done to amount to anything. Why? They would meet
together and talk and outline the situation and necessity for action until
some question came up where somebody was going to lose control of something
or a part of his jurisdiction by some coordinated action for the
benefit of the whole Government. Then immediately the whole thing died
out and nothing was accomplished practically by any Interdepartmental
Board, where anything vital had to be given up by one of the independent
members of it, whose jurisdiction and power would be cut down in the
interest of the common plan of the Government.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the President of the United States assumed this central
control of routine business, he did what any man would do in connection
with a private corporation; he called together in conference the business
administration,—everybody connected with the business of the Government
as head of department or independent establishment—Cabinet Officers
correspond to Vice Presidents in a business corporation. Of necessity
they had allowed this disgraceful system of chaos and extravagance to go
on. It was not their fault any more than it is the fault of you gentlemen,
who have been running along independent lines, because you were not
joined together in a system operating under a central authority. We all
were properly subject to the indictment of loose business methods because
the President of the United States had not imposed a unified plan and
system over us nor had he created the machinery by which this plan would
be carried into effect, as he has since done.</p>

<p class='c010'>In connection with surplus supplies, every department formerly
was selling its supplies in the open-market, and other departments were
buying the same kind of supplies in open market. In a number of cases
speculators would come and buy our public sales material from one department
to sell it to another department at two or three times the price.
Real estate was being leased in cities right along from private owners,
when the Government had vacant property to rent. This was the custom
also in connection with motor transport. If any Department wanted something
moved and did not have motor transport, it would go out and hire
motor transportation. There was no machinery by which the empty motor
trucks and idle men of the other departments could be used.</p>

<p class='c010'>When goods were to be shipped, everybody would route them as they
pleased. There was no unified central authority which could deal with
the services as a whole as regards the classification of freight and the
whole transportation question.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same thing existed in the making of contracts.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_712'>712</span>The same thing existed in Government purchasing. There was
competition between the Departments, the Departments themselves not
being coordinated. In the Treasury Department alone we found 18 separate
points of purchasing activity. Everything was run in Government business
as if it was composed of 41 separate corporations. How were things
changed for the better? It is all simple enough. It all depended on
the President because he alone had the authority to impose the methods
of coordinating and controlling this great general business, just as he
is coordinating these great activities here today through this Board,
presided over by his appointee, General Sawyer, a co-ordinator.</p>

<p class='c010'>The plan which the President adopted was simple enough,—just
what would be done in any business organization—without asking for
any additional legislation for additional employees, but by simply
taking from the body of the employees, officials of the United States,
those men especially qualified by knowledge and experience to act as his
agents, and then creating the machinery through which they could transmit
his policy and plan of unified business to the general organization.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the simplest thing in the world, and the only possible
objection I have ever heard was urged the other day where it was said
that the detail of Army and Navy Officers for this central work by the
President might not result in giving him the benefit of absolute impartiality
of judgment because of their former connection with the War
and Navy departments. That nonsense!</p>

<p class='c010'>For instance, in my bank,—supposing I wanted to take a man
from the Discount Department, from the Foreign Exchange Department, or
the Real Estate Department,—what folly to say that I would be justly
afraid that he would not be my loyal and faithful agent in the imposition
of a plan for the interest of the institution as a whole because of
his former connection with those departments of the bank. What folly
to say that the President of the United States with all his power over
personnel can not receive from men detailed for co-ordinating work the
same loyalty as he would receive from men appointed
from the outside to come into this complex machine. And I say now that
the plan must stand or fall upon that proposition. Regarding Colonel
Smither, the Chief Coordinator, or Commander Stanley, or any of these
men who have been connected with the Army or Navy,—so far as this work
is concerned, as agents for the President of the United States, they are
as independent as if they had never been in the Army or Navy. If anybody
thinks they are not, let us give him an example. We have not
found anything but cooperation from the heads of these departments and
the heads of these services because their personal interests lie parallel
now with the unified plan of the government since the President of the
United States to whom they are responsible, is behind that plan.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the President becomes indifferent,—if he loses his eyes,
and ears and fingers in matters of routine business in the shape of
the Chief Coordinators of the Boards,—if he lets them drift, immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_713'>713</span>there will come the effort from you and everybody else to pull
to pieces this coordinating machinery which alone is able to impose a
unified plan upon the governmental business.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now why is it necessary for you to accept, without mental
reservation, the necessity of the existence of this coordinating board
under which you act and the authority of the Chief Coordinator of that
board as representing the President? Let me say in connection with this
that the rights of the independent departments and establishments are
jealously regarded under these executive orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>What I want to impress upon the minds of all is the necessity
of these co-ordinating boards to enable you to do your work properly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take it in ships. In coordinating shipping transportation,
you have got to have Mr. Weeks, Mr. Denby and Mr. Lasker in contact in
connection with a decision involving the economical use of ships. How
can anybody get them together without the authority of the President?
Suppose I was expected to call them together without the authority of
the President. I would go to Mr. Weeks for example and wait until the
Senators were through seeing him, and then perhaps because of his personal
friendship persuade him to go over with me to see Mr. Denby. When
we had seen Denby how could we get the two together with Lasker? You
could not get anywhere in this co-ordinating work without a delegated
authority from the President to compel contact between high officials.</p>

<p class='c010'>In connection with this great work of yours in which you spent
last year three-fourths of a billion dollars, you cannot have it run
right without the existence of this co-ordinating Board,—without that
authority to make a bird’s-eye view of the whole situation,—without
that authority to say why this building, for example, is unnecessary,
because there exists a superfluity of this sort of building in another
department. What’s the use of endeavoring to catalogue those activities
in which there is duplication, in which you have got to have the bird’s-eye
view, and would never get proper action taken, unless you have in
existence this Board created by the authority of the President!</p>

<p class='c010'>In connection with the rights of your department, for instance,
there is preserved for you at all times in connection with the coordinating
order of the Federal Board of Hospitalization, a right of appeal
to the President of the United States. If this Coordinating Board
interferes to such an extent with the plans of your unit that you think
the disadvantage so great that it counterbalances the beneficial effect
to the government as a whole, the right of appeal to the President is
with you. But for the first time in the government, as you know, there
will be presented to the President by the Chief Coordinator the interests
of the government treated from the standpoint of the Coordinating Board,
so that the President of the United States in making his decision on
your matter has the strongest possible statement of the needs of the
unit from you, and the strongest possible statement of the needs of the
government as a whole from the President of the Board. But the final
authority, of course, is in the President of the United States and he
will exercise it. In all of these orders the right of the head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_714'>714</span>of the independent unit to a proper examination, by the supreme authority,
of his plan is preserved, and it has been so in connection with
all of these coordinating agencies and with the Director of the Budget.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me tell you something as to the spirit of cooperation shown.
I have never had a contest before the President with a cabinet officer
or head of a department in connection with a coordinating action. I have
never had one for this reason. Take in connection with the transfer of
ships,—we have independent agencies for the examination of conditions.
We have the right, as agents of the President, of obtaining information
from any bureau chief or head of a department.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have, through Colonel Smither’s wonderful organization of
course, the means for securing essential knowledge about these things.</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding ships,—we asked the Navy the other day for a couple
of mine sweepers for the Coast and Geodetic Survey. They refused. That
was always the case in the old days. Of course, everybody looks out for
the interest of his own department. Well I called over one of the
Assistant Secretaries of the Navy, and gave him a bird’s-eye view of the
situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had 49 mine sweepers; and they were going out of commission.
If they went to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, they would be
kept in commission and would not deteriorate so rapidly. What is more,
if they didn’t go to the Geodetic Survey, the United States would have
to ask for a million dollars to build new ships.</p>

<p class='c010'>That matter was taken back and proper attention given to it
with this knowledge of the whole situation and the Secretary of the
Navy joined in the request that the ships be transferred.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not the Secretary of the Navy who had really been
responsible for the first decision. It was some fellow along down the
line, without the bird’s-eye view, who has been safe for a hundred years
from the eye of a central authority, thinking in terms of the whole
government—doing what he believed his duty, I admit, in directing
things for the best interests of his unit, but who, without the bird’s-eye
view would have thrown the Government into an unnecessary expense
of a million dollars.</p>

<p class='c010'>It then developed when the Coast and Geodetic Survey people
went to get the mine sweepers, that they were in process of repair;
that the engines were disassembled. Now the Coast and Geodetic Survey
had no appropriation available for repairing work and so the Navy said,
“We won’t spend our money on those ships.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because the President of the United States told us to be
economical.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now supposing there had not been in existence an agency acting
under the President, such as the one here presided over by General
Sawyer which could see what was really involved in that action on the
part of the head of that subordinate unit of the Navy. Because the Navy
wanted to save a repair bill of $10,240.00 the Government would have
spent unnecessarily $1,000,000 for new ships. Do not think that was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_715'>715</span>unusual case! It was almost always so in the old days.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now nobody has been more anxious than the Secretary of the
Navy to cooperate in those matters but he must have information,—and
you must have the information,—to enable one to cooperate. All
that was necessary for me to do was to write to the Secretary of the
Navy, that unless these ships were repaired out of the Navy appropriation
at a cost of $10,240 we would have had to ask for a million
dollars appropriation for new ships. But what if that information
had not been given?</p>

<p class='c010'>The existence of these agencies is necessary to enable this Government
to be run on a business basis. I have given you a simple illustration
in connection with the ships. We transferred thirteen ships with
the acquiescence of the heads of the departments concerned by simply
developing the bird’s-eye view of the situation without ever taking the
matter up with the President, except for the issuance of the Executive
order by agreement.</p>

<p class='c010'>The patriotic head of a unit really welcomes this system by which he
is given the information which enables him to run the activities of his
particular institution in the interest of the Government as a whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>I repeat you must have that bird’s-eye view of the necessities of the
Government as a whole, which alone you can secure through the authority
of the President as exercised through the Coordinator of the Board you
have here. It is absolutely necessary that there should be no withholding
of the spirit of cooperation and loyalty to your Coordinator.
There should be no feeling that your independent jurisdiction is going to
be unnecessarily curtailed and interfered with. There is the right of
appeal, and it is just as important to the proper functioning of the
whole governmental business machine that you have courageous defense of the
department unit as you have courageous defense of the policies of coordination.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is no proper room for friction; and so far as the Budget Bureau
is concerned and the coordinating agencies headed by Colonel Smithers,
we have had a minimum of friction with the departments. There have been
transferred over $112,000,000 dollars worth of property between these
departments within the last six months. $100,000 per year is being saved
in the comparatively small thing right here in the District of Motor
transportation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Anybody who stands against the principle of this thing is a man, in
the first place, who is not intelligent. He is a man in the second place
who is not loyal; and he is a man, in the third place, who is in danger,
in view of the accomplishments of this coordinating work. What excuses
are there for anyone not to give his loyal cooperation to the President
of the United States, who, for the first time, has undertaken to be
responsible for a correct system of routine business?</p>

<p class='c010'>One other thing in connection with the spirit of economy:—the
President of the United States has asked it. He asked it here in the
first meeting of the Govt. business organization last June at which some
of you were present. That request of his has received response. I find over
the country that for the first time in government, economy has become
fashionable, and extravagance dangerous; and all over the country, in the
post office service,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_716'>716</span>the Army service—in all Govt. activities. There is the spirit of
loyal cooperation under the leadership of the President in the matter of
economy.</p>

<p class='c010'>We know, too, what you have been trying to do in that way in your
own service is resulting in an immense saving to the Government.</p>

<p class='c010'>What we need are men in authority to help us find out where savings
can be made. We have only scratched the surface, but it is possible now,
as we get the business of the Government in the proper, organized shape,
to determine where the limit of economy is. We do not know yet, because our
reorganization of routine business methods has not gone on long enough.
We have only been in operation four or five months. It will be a year or
two possibly before the extent of economies can be determined.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in directing the prevention of duplication, etc., in the general
attitude of being desirous to save, as opposed to the old attitude of
being desirous to spend,—all that means that the Government of the United
States can be run more economically than at present provided the President
of the United States gives his attention to the business organization
and he will.”</p>

<p class='c010'>General Dawes concluded his remarks, and as he walked from the stage
General Ireland made a suggestion that he say something in connection with
coordination within the limits of a department itself. General Dawes then
said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“General Ireland asks that I speak about a most important matter. We
cannot get general coordination among the departments unless each department
is coordinated within itself. For instance, we found that in the
Treasury Department there were about eighteen separate points of purchasing
activity. No one man was in touch with all these agencies. The representative
of the Treasury department on the coordinating board, therefore,
could not speak for the eighteen agencies. Therefore, each institution
must coordinate within itself in order that its representative can properly
speak for it on the coordinating board, to say nothing about the desirability
of coordination from the standpoint of the business of that particular
department. Therefore, get your units coordinated.</p>

<p class='c010'>In connection with this whole matter of hospitalization, the eyes of the
country are on you, who are charged with this great responsibility. No
body of men in Government service has more complexing situations to meet than
you have. You are surrounded by every embarrassment. In these days, when
the pinhead demagogues are flourishing; when the mere politician is willing
to capitalize anything, even a wounded soldier, to catch votes, you know
that you are liable to have your constructive work unjustly attacked. To
get into the lime-light many men will sacrifice right principles, and it is
distressing to see the antics of the puny men in public life seeking to
ingratiate themselves in public favor in connection with soldier relief.
The demagogue has no hesitation in attacking those things which are right
only provided they happen to be unpopular. His mind, unlike yours, is not
on the real good of the soldier. He is thinking what the newspapers may
say about him.</p>

<p class='c010'>You must be courageous; you must work for the real good of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_717'>717</span>the soldier; you must work for the real good of the Government; and
I will tell you something. There is no privilege so great, which
comes with public life, as to courageously stand for that which is
right, and in so doing take castigation from demagogues for doing
one’s duty. It all comes out right in the long run.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the midst of your discouraging embarrassments, when
carefully thought out measures of sane relief for wounded veterans
are often attacked by unscrupulous men, who thereby can advertise
for a little time their insignificant personalities; if you sometimes
are tempted to take the easy way and join the yelping pack
of destructive critics, be comforted in the thought of that everlasting
truth that in the long run the man who fearlessly does
right in public place survives, and the man who weakly takes the
wrong way because it is easy receives only ignominy.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_718'>718</span>GEN. SAWYER: It seems unnecessary for me to say, still it is only fair
to General Dawes, that he has injected into the affairs of Government
the greatest enthusiasm and the most interest that has been known in
Government affairs in all the history of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c010'>His idea of coordination, which came to him out of the trying experience
of the war on the other side has certainly served him a wonderful
purpose in the effects that he has brought about in this new plan
of conducting the affairs of the Administration on a business basis,
and I certainly hope that each of you, as you go back to your fields of
activity, will carry with you the idea that you have a most responsible
position. No matter how small your institution, the responsibilities, the liabilities
and the needs are all the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may interest you to know that in the few weeks this present
Board has existed, we have been able to turn over to the various hospitals
of the country in which we have been particularly and necessarily
interested, in a hurry, several million dollars worth of property.
Arrangements are now in operation whereby in caring and preparing for
nearly 11,000 new beds, we have in mind to avail ourselves of the
great resources of the Army and Navy in supplying these needs; and I
must say out of fairness to the heads of those Departments, as represented
by the medical departments, that more hearty cooperation could
not be obtained. To give you an evidence of something of the difference
of today and yesterday, early last summer an appeal came to me
to provide some cots for one of your institutions. It was impossible
for me to locate cots that I could make accessible for the purpose, and
one day one of our own representatives from this Board looking about
found 80 car-loads of these cots at Des Moines, Iowa. Now when we are
in need of cots, we know where to find them and know how to get possession
of them; and this is true of all the things that are really necessary
in the conduct of your affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am here to say to you without any fear of contradiction that
this Hospitalization Board has already accomplished some very helpful
things, and we have many more things in mind. One thing we do not assume,
and that is authority. We have no idea or desire of being autocratic
in our administration but we have a firm determination that regardless
of any sentiment or any emotion which may be brought to influence
the affairs of this Board, we will go on with what we believe
to be the best thing for the men we are trying to serve.</p>

<p class='c010'>I believe that the service we should render and that we must
render, and the only service that is worth while to the veteran, is to
make him well if possible, and, if not, to make him as nearly well as
he can be and as resourceful as he can be and put him back into life
again with confidence in himself, with respect to his Government and
with ambition to make America the leading Government of all the governments
of the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am here to say to you that while you are talking to your patients
about the affairs that arise with you each day, do not forget
as a part of your responsibility and your duty that you help to create
<span class='pageno' id='Page_719'>719</span>a spirit and a determination on the part of the man you are serving to
get back into life again. Discourage in every way you possibly can the
idea of his becoming a barnacle upon this great Ship of State. Encourage
him to believe that the responsibility of the debts that are incurred
here now are debts his children and his grandchildren will have to
pay; and so, while we are talking economy to you, I would impress upon
you this one thought: that economy is only the assurance to yourself
that every hundred cents buys a dollar’s worth. We do not mean by the
economy we are trying to preach here economy that might be regarded as
penuriousness. We want you to have all you need in the best way that
it can be provided for you, but we want you to have concern enough in
the property that is turned over to you to see that it is worth what you pay
for it and that it is used to the best advantage possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yesterday, we decided, I believe, that we would devote an hour
this morning to the answering of some miscellaneous interrogations.
Dr. White, have you received any?</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WHITE: No.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON W. H. SANFORD (R): Having spent the last year and a half in
the Inspection Division, the subject of this excessive amount of
money in the hands of the sick soldier has impressed itself on me
more and more as I inspected the hospitals. It was the cause of
great trouble, and is in my opinion doing more to hinder the patient
than any one factor. Without this $80.00 or $157.50 a month, the
vice and crime and drinking around the institutions could not exist,
and therefore I believe that one of the greatest things that could
be accomplished at this Conference would be for the Committee to
promulgate some way of preventing these men from using that money
in the way it is being used today.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have inspected Ft. Bayard, Ft. Stanton and other large institutions
in the West, and I know these men in charge will agree
with me when I say that the thing that hampers the recovery of the
patients is their right to expend the money the way they want. If
they didn’t have it, the rum-runner and the other vices that come
would not be there. I think it is one of the most important subjects
we could settle, and suggest that it would be well if the
Committee would recommend that we give these men, say, $15.00 a
month, and take care of the rest of their money until they are
ready to go back to their homes.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON J. E. MILLER (R): At our hospital we have a canteen. I suppose
most hospitals have canteens. We have had $3,000 paid into
the hospital—$3,000 a year profit on sales to soldiers. I think
such money could be turned in for the benefit of the soldiers, for
entertainments, Christmas dinners, etc., as that seems the proper
place for it.</p>

<p class='c018'>MR. M. SANGER (St. Elizabeths Hospital): With reference to those
funds of the beneficiaries who are in hospitals, a similar condition</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_720'>720</span>existed for a while with reference to those drawing pensions. That
proposition had to be met. Congress passed a law whereby those people
receiving pensions, who entered soldiers’ homes or hospitals had to pay
that money either to the superintendent of the hospital, the President
of the Soldiers’ Home, or the Governor of the Home, to be cared for
the benefit of the pensioner. Those who had beneficiaries at home received
the benefit of their portion of the pension under supervision of
the Pension Office, the Pension Office having machinery to find out what
beneficiaries had dependents, etc., and what proportion of the pension
should be paid to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The only thing in connection with these funds paid to the hospitals
which led to complaint was the money paid to heads of hospitals or Soldiers’
Homes for deposit in the Treasury, but which was not drawing interest.
This needs corrective legislation. Precedents are at hand.
Moneys paid into the Treasury by beneficiaries or enlisted men of the
Army or Navy are drawing interest. The money from these pensioners
should be drawing interest. These funds, whether from the pensioners
or beneficiaries of the War Risk Bureau should be used as a sinking-fund
possibly to retire the debt of the Government and in that manner to draw
interest. It would help the Government in becoming part of the sinking-fund;
it would help the veteran in that it would permit the money received
to be deposited for his benefit, and would give an opportunity
for regulations to be made to safeguard him; to prevent these people
from coming around the institutions by preventing his having excessive
money to spend. Then when the man is discharged, he would have an estate
with which to begin life and to provide for the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>I think this organization should give some consideration to this
matter. I refer to Acts of February 20, 1905 and February 7, 1909, and
similar acts in regard to Soldiers’ Homes. I think the one thing to be
considered is a means of investing these funds for drawing interest.</p>

<p class='c018'>MAJOR GENERAL M. W. IRELAND: The question of patients having money
while in the hospital is one of the most demoralizing things that can
happen. It has been recognized in the Army for many years.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Philippines we had a sympathetic commanding officer and
we received permission to with-hold a certain portion of the funds.
Then we received word from the Secretary of War that it was contrary
to law; that the money was earned by the soldier, and had to be paid
to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>I think you are going to find the same is true of compensation.
If you are going to hold the compensation of the man while he is in
the hospital, you will have to get an Act of Congress. I think,
therefore, that you should consider the amount of compensation the man
should get while in the hospital; consider the proposition of maybe
reducing his compensation while in the hospital, being cared for by
the Government.</p>

<p class='c018'>SENIOR SURGEON J. E. DEDMAN (R): I am glad this subject came up.
A year and a half ago, a committee of T. B. experts came to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_721'>721</span>hospital and we discussed that question. I made the statement that many
of the men in our hospitals were getting too much money. It was immediately
taken up by the American Legion, and they said all kinds of unkind
things about me. I said that men who never had any money in their lives
single boys, etc., were getting $80.00 a month and that this was too much
money.</p>

<p class='c010'>I cited the instance of where a lady came into my office, weeping.
She said she had been dependent upon her son; that he had gotten that
day a check for $1200; had bought an automobile for $1500; and had gone
$300 in debt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The greatest set of vultures we have to contend with are the automobile
salesmen. For instance, they come and sell to our boys for $700
cars which would sell for $400. If the boy has $500, they charge him
$750 in order to get notes and keep him in debt.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am in favor of getting an Act of Congress to put the man’s money
at interest, so that when he is rehabilitated he will have something to
take care of himself. As it is now the boys are spending their money
for hootch, automobiles, etc., and instead of rehabilitating them we
are ruining them.</p>

<p class='c018'>MR. M. SANGER, St. Elizabeths’ Hospital: In regard to the question of
General Ireland, the pension regulations include a provision that one
part of the pension shall be devoted to reimbursing the hospital for
part of the care. I think that would serve in a way to admit of
those in hospital getting less while there than when outside.</p>

<p class='c018'>SENIOR SURGEON G. B. YOUNG, U.S.P.H.S. While on the subject I offer the
suggestion that something might be done along this line in connection
with the disciplinary regulations, which provide that when a man is
discharged for disciplinary reasons his compensation will be withheld
for a certain period.  We all know that we sometimes will have
to discharge people for disciplinary reasons, and it may happen that
the offense is of such a character and the man of such a character as
to make you feel that the sentence you have to impose upon him as
compared to that which you have to impose upon a flagrant offender
is lacking in elasticity. It seems to me that it would be well in
this connection to consider whether the regulations could provide
for the with-holding of compensation by the Veterans’ Bureau for a
greater period as an incentive to better conduct, so that the man
might be returned to the hospital with the incentive that if he behaves
satisfactorily that this money which had been withheld would be restored.
As it is a man has to be discharged and he goes out penniless,
because he hasn’t anything coming to him for several months.
If he could look forward to a suspended sentence, I think that would
save some of the better element among these possible unintentional
offenders and get them back into a line of good behavior.</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL JAMES A. MATTISON, N.H.D.V.S. This question which was brought up
by Congressman Madden, General Ireland and others is a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_722'>722</span>pertinent one. This method of handling the funds of men of former wars
has been in effect in the National Home service for many years. The
matter just spoken of in regard to handling this money in a disciplinary
way has also been a feature. In regard to the men who have been offenders,
who have been continually guilty of getting drunk, the commanding officer
of each hospital had the authority to with-hold, as a disciplinary
measure, any part or the whole of a man’s pension until such time as he
saw fit to turn the money over to the man or a part of it. Of course
the matter of with-holding pension money in the case of men of former
wars is of much less importance. Formerly, these men were getting $10,
$20 and $25 a month, and when Congress passed a pension law providing
$30 a month, they saved money. That does not compare with the pensions
our soldiers of the recent war are receiving, $80, $100 and $150 a month,
and, as has been stated by several men already, it has been and is going
to continue to be one of the greatest factors in preventing these men
from being restored to an active state in life again.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the matter of the corrupt conditions which have been described
as existing around these hospitals, it is something that cannot be prevented.
Every effort has been made. The civil authorities have been
appealed to and in most cases they have given undivided co-operation.
Personally, I feel that it is an exceedingly important matter.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON J. B. ANDERSON (R): If I have interpreted the regulations
correctly, we are not permitted to have a canteen around the hospital.
If I am in error, I should like to know it.</p>

<p class='c018'>LIEUT. COL. W. H. MONCRIEF, U.S.A.: Contrary to the impression given
here yesterday afternoon, revelry does not maintain at Fitzsimmons
Hospital. I think we have a well-ordered institution. The matter of
compensation does give us some concern.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have four classes of patients,—Army, Navy, beneficiaries of
Soldiers’ Homes and of the Veterans’ Bureau. On the day I left, we had
a total of 980 patients, 719 of which were Veterans’ Bureau beneficiaries.
These are officers, ex-nurses and ex-enlisted men. I will say
that the behavior of these people during my tour of duty at the hospital
compares favorably with that of any other institution. We have
our troubles; if we didn’t have them, I don’t suppose the institution
would need a commanding officer.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the question of compensation is one that is not easily adjusted
unless it is adjusted at the source. It is impossible to give you an
idea—unless you have charge of one of these institutions—of how much
trouble the commanding officer is going to have if the responsibility
of withholding this compensation is put on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are near a large city—not too near and not too far—but we
are surrounded by people who want to offer at all times every inducement
to the enlisted men to spend this amount of compensation in the most advantageous
manner. This class ranges from the peddler of tin toys to
the most reliable banking firms in the city of Denver. Those bank
representatives wait on us. Since I have been there, I have had to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_723'>723</span>pursue the policy of excluding from the reservation all solicitation
whatsoever, my argument being that it was my duty, to protect the T. B.
patients; that if one solicitor were allowed, others must be allowed;
and that I had no time nor inclination to pass upon the merits of the
various propositions offered. I have not had a great deal of trouble;
and since I have been able to get the representative people to understand
this situation—and I take particular pains to inform all my personnel
that reputable firms and others are aware of this prohibition—it is assumed
that anyone soliciting on the reservation is not reputable.</p>

<p class='c010'>I think a great deal can be done in regard to taking care of this
matter by the social service work in the hospitals. The good people of
Denver have been very kind in every way.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. BUTLER: In view of the fact that economy seems to be the order
of the day, and to have economy the bird’s-eye view has been pointed
out to organizations this morning, I suggest that as a fitting slogan
for this body, the words. “Cultivate a bird’s-eye view” be adopted.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: I don’t know just what authority you gentlemen have in
regard to the matter of solicitors, but at White Oaks Farm if interruptions
such as these attempted to exist, somebody would get hurt.
I would not tolerate the existence of such affairs. There is no reason
why you should, and if there is any reason why you shouldn’t, this
Board can help you to bring about some regulation or some rule whereby
it will be possible for you to protect yourselves and your people
against such imposition as this. Be assured that this Board is going
to provide it; but I really think that if you will exercise your authority
as commanding officers and not allow these people to intrude
upon you, you will be able to cure a lot of your difficulties at
home.</p>

<p class='c018'>SURGEON J. M. WHEATE (R), U.S.P.H.S.: A year ago we were swarmed with
agents, and I sent out a hospital regulation prohibiting that. It
is easy to issue regulations, but hard to put them into effect, so
I have made it a rule to make my regulations as few as possible. This,
however, I found to be a necessary regulation, and I prohibited agents
of all kinds from access to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_724'>724</span>We have a hundred-acre field, which is approachable in a hundred
different ways, and there is no way of keeping such agents out of
the reservation. I had my Captain of the Watch made a Deputy United
States Marshal. I had my head orderly made a constable for the
county. They helped me to maintain order outside the reservation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The matter of compensation has been a big problem with all of
us. I recall that about the first time I got “in bad” with my patients
was early in the game. I was waited on by a delegation of
patients in my office one morning, who asked if I were properly
quoted in the morning paper. I had not seen the paper.</p>

<p class='c010'>A day or two before, a committee of Legion men called at my
office (we had most happy relations with the local Legion heads).
One of this Committee was the editor of a local paper. Among the
general things we discussed was the abuse of compensation. I said
I wished we had some law like Canada, whereby all but one-fourth of
the compensation could be withheld, as I believed that ten dollars
a month was enough for a sick man in the hospital. This was discussed
and it sounded reasonable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next day, to my surprise, the editor of the local paper
printed the story of my recommendation; and the young chap, thinking
I suppose to give me the credit for the thought, quoted me freely.</p>

<p class='c010'>The soldiers appointed a committee to wait on me. They wanted
to know if I thought it fair to the United States soldier. They said
it was their money and that they proposed to spend it as they saw fit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Out of this controversy grow consideration by the Legion; and in
course of time that Legion Post sent a committee man to Washington, who
had a long conference with Mr. Sweet; and indirectly I may be much to
be condemned or praised for introducing into the Sweet Bill the measure
of withholding compensation. Our committee man who went up there stated
that it was a rather new thought to Mr. Sweet and that he waved it aside
at first, but that later he showed interest and finally said he was going
to rewrite his bill, incorporating that idea.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it did not go nearly as far as I recommended; that is, the
adoption of the Canadian form of withholding all but one-fourth. There
is no need to discuss that. Mr. Sweet said it was illegal; that compensation
is a wage; but he compromised by saying we could fine the men.</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding my drastic order, I might add that I do allow the agents
of the banks to come in, and I am proud to say that we do handle much of
our trouble by depositing money either for checking accounts or savings.
I think that about forty per cent of our men are carrying savings accounts
in the local banks.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have at least 160 N. P. cases in my hospital, although it is officially
a T. B. hospital. As you know, the regulation provides that if
a man is not capable of handling his money, his compensation check will be
sent to the Commanding Officer, who is held responsible for the money.
I put the money in the bank, giving to the man, after conferring with the
Chief of the N. P. Section, such funds as he may need.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_725'>725</span>SURGEON M. J. WHITE: Early in 1919, when I first opened Palo Alto,
I made recommendation for the amendment of the Act, so that the Compensation
of a patient might be held until he had completely recovered,
and I see no reason why there is a legal bar to it. I think Congress
can say that Compensation is payable when a man has completely recovered
and is discharged from the hospital. We cannot undertake to
protect the patients from sharks. For instance, we give a man a pass;
he goes down town and spends his money. As long as he has money in
his pocket, he will spend it. I think it would be legal for Congress
to say that Compensation will be payable when the man has reached maximum
hospital treatment or when he is properly discharged. Otherwise,
if a patient has accumulated, say, $160, he starts a disturbance and
you have to give him the money.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPTAIN F. W. Wieber, U.S.N.:—I am glad to say that we have had very
little trouble with our Veterans’ Bureau patients. We have, however,
had trouble occasionally, but I have always been able to attend to
these matters myself, for I have a good understanding with a U. S.
Attorney, who helps me out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding money, it would be the best thing if most of the Compensation
to the men could be withheld. They may have dependent families,
so no uniform rule could guide us in our action. I do not
think it should be left to the Commanding Officer, for in the first
place, we do not know how much money the men should receive.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to the matter of smuggling into the reservation,
I sent a request to the Surgeon General to be allowed to put up a
fence but I have never heard from it. I am going to recommend to my
successor that he call attention to that matter again. The reservation
at Fort Lyon covers 1100 acres, and a portion should be enclosed
with a fence. There has been much stealing there, and we have often
found the stolen articles in houses around the reservation. The building
of a fence would be expensive, but it would counter-balance the loss
of government property.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the benefit of the gentlemen who may succeed at Fort Lyon soon,
I might say that when I was ordered to Fort Lyon I was very much grieved;
I knew it was in a desert, and everybody who had been there gave such a
discouraging report. My sentiment in that matter has changed to such an
extent that if the place had remained in the hands of the Navy, I should
have liked to have remained there. We are a happy family of about
fourteen commissioned officers and we have formed a little community of
ourselves, being independent of the outside world to a large extent.
We have our power house, ice plant, community house, social meetings,
and in fact we are as independent as can be.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the flood, we were able, for about two weeks to attend to
our own things, and after that we were able to help the outsiders. So,
to those gentlemen I want to say that they need not be disconsolate upon
receiving orders to go to Fort Lyon.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_726'>726</span>I think it is ideal for the T. B. patients. We have the dry
climate, constant sun-shiny days, cool nights, and everything conducive
to the proper treatment of T. B. Everything is complete, and
the people are greatly benefited by their stay in our vicinity, as can
be attested by the fact that many former Navy People, who had been in
the institution, are now living there and are as strong as any person
in the East.</p>

<p class='c010'>I might say that the people who have had T. B. and who are doing
well out west had better make up their minds to stay our there for fear
that change of conditions might bring about activity again in their
cases.</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding a uniform system of treatment as suggested, I do not
believe any strict rules should be set. We can have a sort of general
system, but no uniform method as to the hours of rest, food, etc.
At Fort Lyon, rest is now being enforced, and every patient gets two
rest periods, i. e., from 9 to 11 A.M. and from 1 to 3 P.M. Liberty is
allowed only once a week; and overnight, once a month. Those who would
be discontented anywhere have left, and those who have stayed feel they
have our sympathy and support and are doing well.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER asked for resolutions from the Resolutions Committee.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL IRELAND: “Your committee has gone over the resolutions that have
been presented, and we find all of them in order, with the exception
of one submitted by Colonel Bratton with reference to transportation
home. We would inform you that there will have to be legislation to
carry out that resolution. We have changed the resolution to read as
follows:</p>

<p class='c028'>‘That the Director of the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau be requested
to secure legislation so that the expenses of the patient’s
transportation to his bona fide home, when he has been discharged
for disciplinary reasons, be deducted from his compensation,
when compensation is being given, or may be given
thereafter.’</p>

<p class='c010'>As changed, I recommend that the resolution be adopted by the meeting
as read.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This <span class='under'><em class='gesperrt'>Motion</em></span> was seconded, and carried.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPTAIN N. J. BLACKWOOD, U. S. N.:—The Committee on Forms has held two
meetings at which the general subject of this work was discussed and
plans agreed upon. This work is so great that your Committee finds
it impossible to report more than progress at present. The whole
matter must be gone into carefully and thoroughly in order to avoid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_727'>727</span>mistakes and duplications of the past. The work, to be a success,
will require frequent meetings, careful study and cooperation.
Therefore, it seems wise that all members of the Committee be officers
on duty in Washington, and I recommend that the present chairman,
Captain Blackwood, be relieved, and that his place be filled by
Captain M. S. Elliott, Commanding Officer of the Naval Hospital; also,
that all Commanding Officers here present shall, as soon as possible
after returning to their respective commands, take up the subject of
forms and paper work regarding Veterans’ Bureau patients, and as soon
thereafter as possible submit to the Veterans’ Bureau, Washington,
recommendations and suggestions for the elimination, provision and simplification
both of the forms themselves and their numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon receipt of these letters, your Committee will then
take up the whole subject in a more comprehensive way and will,
as soon as possible, submit its recommendations for your consideration
and approval.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <span class='under'><em class='gesperrt'>MOTION</em></span> was seconded and carried.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Honorable Charles H. Burke presiding.</p>

<p class='c010'>The roll was called by Dr. W. A. White.</p>

<p class='c018'>MR. BURKE: “We will proceed with the afternoon program. The first
subject is “Foreign Relations of the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau in care
of ex-soldiers of the former allied countries.” It will be discussed
by Dr. F. D. Hester of the Veterans’ Bureau”.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. HESTER: read as follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE U.S. VETERANS’ BUREAU</div>
    <div class='c003'>IN CARE OF</div>
    <div class='c003'>EX-SOLDIERS OF THE FORMER ALLIED COUNTRIES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As I note that the program upon which I have been placed refers
to foreign relations of the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau in care of ex-soldiers
of the formed-allied countries, with your permission I
will add to that, the care of U.S. ex-service men in foreign countries.
The care of U.S. ex-service men in this country has been
discussed from every angle, and it would seem proper that we should
also refer to his care in foreign countries from a medical standpoint,
as well as to the care of the allied ex-service man in this
country.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>THE LAW PROVIDING FOR THE CARE OF U.S. EX-SERVICE MEN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES</div>

<p class='c010'>As act of Congress, Public 104, Sixty-sixth Congress, approved
December 24, 1919, provides that the Bureau of War Risk
Insurance, now the Veterans’ Bureau, is authorized, to furnish
transportation, also medical, surgical, and hospital services
to discharged members of the military or naval forces of those
Governments which have been associated in war with the United
States since April 6, 1917, and come within the provisions of
laws of such Governments similar to the War Risk Insurance Act,
at such rates and under such regulations as the Director of the
Bureau of War Risk Insurance may prescribe, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>AUTHORIZATION FOR SERVICE</div>

<p class='c010'>You will note that this provision of the law stipulates
at such rates and under such regulations as the Director of the
Bureau of War Risk Insurance may prescribe. The regulation
that has been issued by the Director of the U.S. Veterans’
Bureau provides that in all cases where application for treatment
is made by ex-members of the military or naval forces of
the allies, such treatment will be furnished only on the
specific authorization of the Director of the U.S. Veterans’
Bureau upon authority obtained from the Government concerned,
to incur the expense of treatment in each case. When treatment
is so authorized, the same procedure is to be followed
as in cases of application made by ex-members of the Canadian
forces, which is as follows:</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_802'>802</span>
  <h3 class='c041'>RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT WITH CANADA:</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>An agreement entered into between the Canadian and this Government
upon reciprocal lines provides that when an honorably discharged
member of the military or naval forces of the Allies, resident in the
United States or its territorial possessions, requires medical or
surgical treatment for a disability contracted in, due to, or increased
by his military or naval service, he shall apply to the nearest medical
representative of the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau. If such representative
is not available, information regarding the address of the nearest
medical representative of the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau may be secured
through any local representative of the American Red Cross, the American
Legion, the Y.M.C.A., the Salvation Army, the Knights of Columbus, or
other volunteer agency.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>METHOD OF PROCEDURE WHEN APPLICATION IS MADE FOR TREATMENT:</h3>

<p class='c020'>When application for treatment is made by an ex-member of the
Canadian forces, the medical representative of the U.S. Veterans’
Bureau to whom such application is made will communicate with the
District Manager in order to obtain particulars regarding the man’s
military or naval status and medical history, and the District Manager
will communicate with the Bureau (Assistant Director, Medical Division,
Attention Foreign Relations Section), which will obtain from the Government
of Canada the necessary information. If additional information
is required, the District Manager, if speed be necessary, will request
such additional information by telegram. In no case should treatment be
undertaken pending receipt of authority from the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau,
unless the call be one of emergency, and in all emergency cases the
medical officer in the field is authorized to give prompt service.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>

<p class='c020'>The articles of agreement with Canada have been supplemented with
a letter of instructions that clearly sets forth just how service is to
be given by representatives of this Bureau to beneficiaries of the
Canadian Government. This letter of instruction is a guide for the
representatives of this Bureau in the field as to proper procedure when
any doubtful situation should arise, and has been sent to the District
Managers in such numbers as to furnish each medical officer with a copy.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is possible that some of you gentlemen are not in possession of
these instructions; should such be the case, a number of copies are at
your disposal here, and may be obtained from the stenographers’ table.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>NUMBER OF CANADIAN EX-SERVICE MEN CARED FOR BY THIS BUREAU:</h3>

<p class='c020'>It may not be out of order to mention at this time that the U.S.
Veterans’ Bureau through its Foreign Relations Section, Medical Division,
has cared for over 9,000 Canadian ex-service men. When I say Canadian
ex-service men, please know that these are not in reality Canadians,
but that 95% of the number are American boys, who, through their valor
and enthusiasm, rushed into the breach in the early stages of the conflict,
having crossed the Canadian border in 1914, 1915, 1916 and 1917.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_803'>803</span>Their Services having been rendered under the English flag in Canadian
organizations, these boys are properly beneficiaries of the Canadian
Government, and are being cared for by that Government through the U.S.
Veterans’ Bureau, Foreign Relations Section, Medical Division, by cooperation
with the Department of Soldiers’ Civil Re-Establishment,
which is an organization of the Canadian Government, similar to the U.
S. Veterans’ Bureau. The personnel of the Department of Soldiers’
Civil Re-Establishment is something over 6,000, divided into 10 medical
units, or districts. The Foreign Relations Section, Medical Division,
of the Bureau is constantly in receipt of requests for service from
allied ex-service men with whose government this Bureau has no reciprocal
agreement. These cases are promptly referred to the representative
of that government located in Washington with a view of giving service
if the Government under whose flag the man served will authorize the
service.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>REPORTS TO BE MADE UPON CANADIAN FORMS 346,399 and 76.:</h3>

<p class='c020'>Your attention is particularly called to the necessity of forwarding
to the Bureau reports required by the Canadian Government regarding
the hospitalization of Canadian ex-service men; and I desire to stress
this point, that, when a medical examination is made of a Canadian
ex-service man, the report of your findings should be furnished on S.
C.R. Form 346 (S.C.R. meaning Soldiers’ Civil Re-Establishment), this
Form being similar in requirements to the Bureau Medical Division Form
2545. It is upon the findings in this report mode upon S.C.R. 346 that
the Canadian Government gives its approval for hospitalization. S.C.R.
Form 399 is a Progress Report, and should be rendered monthly during the
man’s stay in hospital, for the reason that until this report is received
no pension will be paid to the man or to his dependents. When a
Canadian beneficiary is hospitalized his compensation is reduced, but
the family allowance, should he have dependents, is increased. $40
is the maximum pension payable to a man while in hospital, $10 of which
is paid to him and $30 held in reserve, which is accumulative, and is
given to him upon discharge from hospital. The family allowance is
increased according to the number of his dependents, and is paid to his
family direct. S.C.R. Form. 76 is a discharge report from hospital and
should be rendered promptly in triplicate, as all these reports should
be. If you are not in possession of these Canadian Forms, 346, 399 and
76, they may be obtained from the District Manager in whose district you
are located.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>EX-MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND NAVAL FORCES OF THE UNITED KINGDOM:</h3>

<p class='c020'>At this time the Veterans’ Bureau has completed agreements whereby
service is being given to British ex-service men, which includes ex-members
of the military and naval forces of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as those of
Canada.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>RUSSIAN ALLIED EX-SERVICE MEN:</h3>

<p class='c020'>In addition to the above named may be included the Russian allied
ex-service men, an agreement having been entered into with the Russian
Ambassador now located in Washington, whose official status has not
changed since his appointment as a representative of the late Czar.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_804'>804</span>When medical, surgical, or hospital treatment is requested for a
Russian ex-service man, it must be approved in advance by the Russian
Ambassador, who certifies that any expense incident to this service
will be reimbursed by the Russian Ambassador.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>CZECHOSLOVAKIAN EX-SERVICE MEN:</h3>

<p class='c020'>Through an agreement with the Czechoslovakian Minister, this
service is also furnished to the Czechoslovakian allied ex-service
men upon request from the Minister of that country, accompanied by a
statement that any expense incident to service will be reimbursed by
his Government.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT:</h3>

<p class='c020'>An agreement is pending at this time with the British Government
to provide service for all U.S. ex-service men who may be permanently
or temporarily domiciled in the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>CO-OPERATION OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN GIVING SERVICE TO U.S. EX-SERVICE MEN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.:</h3>

<p class='c020'>All medical, surgical, or hospital service that may be required
for U.S. ex-service men now in foreign countries is provided for by
this Bureau through co-operation with representatives abroad of the
Department of State, this Bureau authorizing such service upon receipt
of information that the man is in need of such service, and upon the
establishment of his identity and the fact that the disability for
which treatment is requested was due to or aggravated by his U.S.
military service. Any expense incident to this service is provided for
by this Bureau and is paid for through the State Department by transfer
of appropriation. This procedure has been found very satisfactory,
for the reason that it expedites the service to the man and simplifies
the accounting problem by the prompt payment of any expense that may
have been incurred.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES MADE BY PHYSICIANS DESIGNATED BY U.S. CONSUL:</h3>

<p class='c020'>For the past six months a ruling has been in effect that where a
Bureau beneficiary in a foreign country was ordered for examination,
he must appear before a physician designated by the U.S. Consul only,
and that unless a report was received within three months from the date
of the letter directing him to appear, or to furnish satisfactory evidence
to the Bureau as to the cause of his inability to report, his
compensation, if he received such, would be held in suspense pending
the report of his medical examination. The result of this procedure
in securing an examination by competent physicians has been that more
satisfactory reports are received.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_805'>805</span>
  <h3 class='c041'>CHECKS SENT TO BENEFICIARIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES:</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The records of the Bureau for the month of December show that at
this time there were 5,977 beneficiaries of the Bureau to whom checks
were sent, totalling in value $489,714. These beneficiaries are resident
in foreign countries located in all parts of the earth, as is
shown by the tabulated statement submitted.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>SOME CASES OF INTEREST:</h3>

<p class='c020'>In order that you may have a slight conception of the far-reaching
effect of the strong arm of this Government in giving aid to its ex-service
men wherever located, which means that they are scattered all
over the earth, I believe that it will serve my purpose if I cite a few
cases that may prove of interest to you. I shall with-hold the names of
these men and refer to them by numbers only.</p>

<h5 class='c032'>CASE NO. 1:</h5>

<p class='c020'>In this case a member of Congress came to the Veterans’ Bureau and
stated that he had been excursioned around from department to department
in his effort to obtain assistance in coming to the rescue of a boy who
had been discharged from the U.S. military service against medical advice,
suffering from melancholia, and who was sent to his home at the
earnest request of his parents, as it was believed that his return to
normalcy would be more quickly effected in the environment of his home
and under parental care, than in a hospital. The Congressman went on to
relate that after remaining home for about four months, the boy was one
day reported missing. Diligent inquiry and searching parties failed to
locate him, and a river nearby suggested the possibility of an accident
or suicide. We will drop the curtain on this distressing situation, for
we know by the law of the universal heart of the suffering that must
have followed in that afflicted home.</p>

<h6 class='c032'>LOCATED IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA:</h6>

<p class='c020'>After a lapse of fourteen months a letter was received from Sydney,
Australia, addressed to a small town in a Southern State, signed by the
Christian name of the writer, Henry, we will call him. The letter was
a rambling, disconnected communication, addressed to no one, not even to
the Postmaster, but simply to the town. The Postmaster, being the self-appointed
recipient of the Communication, incidentally mentioned it to
the father of the missing boy. The father did not associate the letter
in any way with his lost son, but that evening upon returning home, he
told his wife of the letter which the Postmaster had mentioned. I can
almost see in your faces now that you have read the sequel to my story,
that the mother’s love quickly put the question: “Did you see that
letter?” and when the father said, “No”, the mother insisted that the
letter must be from her lost boy. A visit to the Postmaster was made
immediately, the letter was produced and identified by the mother as
having been written by her boy. The letter was then two months old.
The Congressman had come to see what could be done as to locating the
boy in far away Australia.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_806'>806</span>Although the distance between the yearning mother and her lost boy was
over 12,000 miles, I do not think I am exaggerating when I state that
within thirty minutes after learning the facts a cablegram was under
the water, requesting that the Consul General at Sydney cause a thorough
search to be made in the hospitals and other institutions in the city
with a view of finding the boy whose personal description was furnished,
and to hospitalize if necessary and cable results. Within two days
a reply was received, stating that the boy had been found and placed
in a hospital. He has subsequently been returned to the United States,
where he is now being cared for as a beneficiary of this Bureau, and I
am glad to say that he is progressing satisfactorily. Is it strange
that the Congressman and the Bureau should have the gratitude of these
parents?</p>

<h5 class='c032'>CASE NO. 2.:</h5>

<p class='c020'>A medical officer of the U.S. Army while traveling in Northern
Africa stopped over night at a hotel in Algiers and there learned of
the presence and illness of a U.S. Ex-service man. This young officer
was out of funds and in need of hospitalization. The attention of the
Surgeon General of the Army was called to the case, who in turn advised
the Veterans’ Bureau of the man’s distress. The State Department
was called by telephone and requested to cable the U.S. Consul at
Algiers, directing him to give immediate service to this American boy
and report action taken, with the result that the boy was promptly
cared for and sent by first available transportation to Marseilles,
France, where he was hospitalized.</p>

<h5 class='c032'>CASE NO. 3.:</h5>

<p class='c020'>This case is that of a navy man whose disappearance was a mystery
to his family. The first information as to his location was obtained
through the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau, Medical Division, as the result of
a telegram received from the Director Medical Services, Department of
Soldiers’ Civil Re-Establishment, Ottawa, Canada, which stated that a
man had been arrested there as a vagrant; that he was apparently a
mental case, and had been in the U.S. Navy. His name was furnished
and his identity established through the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery
of the Navy. He was promptly hospitalized by the Bureau through the
co-operation of the Canadian officials and returned to this country
with an attendant, where he is under treatment at St. Elizabeth’s
Hospital.</p>

<h3 class='c041'>PURPOSE OF THE BUREAU’S ENDEAVORS:</h3>

<p class='c020'>I might go on to cite many such cases, but my time allotted is insufficient.
My purpose is simply to inform you that it is the wish of
the Director and his associates in the Veterans’ Bureau that it and
its co-operating agencies may give to each case a human touch, reflecting
personal interest and I can think of no better maxim for our guidance
than the title of Charles Reade’s book, “Put Yourself In His Place,”—and
give service as you would have it given unto you.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_807'>807</span>MR. BURKE: stated that in the absence of Major Fraser his subject would
be taken up by Mr. Milliken.</p>

<p class='c018'>MR. J. B. MILLIKEN, of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau, discussed the subject
“Relation of U. S. Veterans’ Bureau to other existing bureaus in caring
for its beneficiaries”, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ladies, Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen: The subject of my twenty
minutes talk to you might more appropriately be termed the relation
of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau to all the Executive Departments of the
Government, for indeed, there is not a Department of this government
with which the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau does not have a vital and immediate
contact.</p>

<p class='c010'>Probably there are three Executive Departments of the Government
with which the Bureau has more contact than with the other Executive
Departments—that of the Treasury Department, the War Department, and
the Navy Department. Inasmuch as the U. S. Public Health Service is
a part of the Treasury Department our contact with this Department of the
government is immediate and vital, and is of more immediate importance
than our contact with the other Executive Departments.</p>

<p class='c010'>As is appreciated, no hospitals are operated directly by the U. S.
Veterans’ Bureau, and all hospitals with the exception of contract hospitals
are operated by the other independent establishments of the government,
the Public Health Service of course having the lion’s share in
providing facilities, and prior to the Act of August 9, 1921 creating the
U. S. Veterans’ Bureau, the U. S. Public Health Service had charge of the
various fourteen district offices where was stationed at each district
office a Supervisor.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Secretary of the Treasury’s order of April 19, 1921 transferred
the functions of the District Supervisor’s Office to the then Bureau of
War Risk Insurance, and the Act of August 9, 1921 transferred by law the
activities of these offices to the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau, but left unhampered
the jurisdiction and authority of the U. S. Public Health Service
concerning matters of hospitalization.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without the work of the facilities afforded by the U. S. Public
Health Service it would indeed be impossible for the U. S. Veterans’
Bureau to function and discharge its obligations relative to the hospitalization,
medical care, and treatment of disabled ex-service men and women.
Co-ordination of their work has led to the fullest cooperation on the
part of every agency, to the end that the disabled ex-service man is
receiving the best treatment which a grateful government can provide. You
have, of course, before you all the data and information relative to the
extent of the work carried on by the U. S. Public Health Service as it
relates to the beneficiaries of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_808'>808</span>The relation of this Bureau to the War and Navy Departments is
fundamental, for the reason that before any person can be accorded
the benefits provided for under the act creating the U. S. Veterans’
Bureau, a record must be obtained from the War or Navy Department showing
the military or naval record of the person seeking benefits either
for compensation, insurance, vocational training, or medical care and
treatment. Something over 900,000 requests have been made to date on
the War and Navy Departments requesting a transcript of the military
or naval record of the person while in the active service and there
has been no diminution in the number of reports requested daily, in
that our average number of requests each day is about 1,000. The matter
of furnishing adequately the transcript of record of an ex-service man
or woman, showing whether or not they received any medical treatment
while in the active service is indeed a most difficult problem. It must
be remembered cases are now arising where a given individual has been
discharged from the military or naval service for a period of approximately
three years, and that in all probability they did not receive medical
care or treatment while in the service, but their health has become
impaired subsequent to their discharge from the service. Quite true
they might have had some slight attack of influenza while in the service
or some other disability, but did not report for medical care and treatment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most of these individuals believe that the War or the Navy
Department should have had a record of such indisposition on their part,
and that, in turn, it is up to the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau to secure
such a record upon which to predicate the service origin of a given
disability. Certainly not in the history of this government has the
military and naval establishments been called upon to complete and
compile the records of statistics and facts comparable to that resulting
from the late war, and while there have been many mistakes made both
on the part of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau in requesting the information
and on the part of the War and Navy Departments in submitting information,
the great bulk of work has been performed in a most satisfactory manner,
and great benefits have been accorded to those applying for the same under
the beneficent laws passed by our Congress.</p>

<p class='c010'>On January 1st, 1922 there had been filed with the U. S. Veterans’
Bureau 81400 claims for compensation. In each and every claim filed it
was necessary to request the War or Navy Department for the military or
naval record of the person applying for compensation benefits, and in
many instances it was necessary to make duplicate requests because of
inadequate identification given or of additional evidence which the
claimant submitted which would make it possible for the War or Navy Department
to make a more exhaustive search of their records. To show the
promptness with which reports have been received from the War and Navy
Departments for no claim is either allowed or disallowed without a
report from the War or Navy Department—out of the 814,000 claims
filed, 51% have been allowed, 41% have been disallowed, and 8% are pending
awaiting information either from the War or Navy Departments or from
the claimant himself.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_809'>809</span>Also to December 15th, 1921, 486,884 former service men had
requested vocational training. It was necessary for the Rehabilitation
Division of the Federal Board for Vocational Education, (now a part of
the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau), to request the military or naval record
from the War or Navy Department, and out of that number 299,000 had been
declared eligible for training; 135,000 had been declared ineligible for
training; and 51,000 cases were pending to determine their rights to
vocational training. These figures also represent a tremendous work
required of the War and Navy Departments in that the records of each man
must be obtained before final disposition was made of the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>When viewed from the stupendous task, the results accomplished are
indeed commendable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great assistance of the War and Navy Departments should also not
be overlooked when it is remembered that at the date of the signing of
the Armistice there were approximately $40,000,000,000 worth of insurance
in force which had been written through the service of the War and Navy
Departments in providing insurance officers to make contact with every
man who was a member of the military or naval forces.</p>

<p class='c010'>The War and navy Departments have always been of tremendous assistance
in the matter of hospitalization of ex-service men and women. On
December 1st, there were 1,410 beds occupied in Army Hospitals, and
2,032 beds occupied in Naval Hospitals. Certainly then from this resumé
of facts the contact with the War and Navy Departments is most vital.</p>

<p class='c010'>The contact of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau with the Post Office
Department is apparent. It need only be mentioned that to date the U.S.
Veterans’ Bureau, representing the consolidated agencies since their
organization have received approximately 90,000,000 incoming pieces of mail,
and have dispatched approximately 105,000,000 pieces of mail, and the
daily average receipt of incoming mail in the Bureau, even under decentralization,
is approximately 41,000 pieces of mail per day and the outgoing
pieces of mail from the Central Office of the Veterans’ Bureau is
approximately 58,000 pieces of mail per day.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Veterans’ Bureau as you have been informed relative to the care
of ex-service men of foreign allied countries and of American soldiers
residing in allied countries has a vital contact with the State Department
in addressing their communications to the various foreign countries and
in the utilization of the various U. S. Consuls.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Department of Justice has charge of all suits filed against the
U. S. Veterans’ Bureau where suit is brought on an insurance contract.
The department of Justice also handles all prosecutions where irregularities
are found under the act creating the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_810'>810</span>Under the Interior Department you know of the use made of the St.
Elizabeth’s Hospital and of hospitals under the jurisdiction of the
Commissioners of Indian Affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The contact is also quite vital with the Department of the Interior
in obtaining various information from the Pension Bureau as a person
may be filing an application for compensation and also an application for
a pension.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Department of Agriculture has been of very great assistance
to the Bureau in rendering advice relative to the training of disabled
ex-service men with a vocational handicap who desire to take up agricultural
pursuits, and at the present time the Department of Agriculture
is rendering most valuable service in mapping out agricultural courses
for the first Vocational School of the Government located at Chillicothe,
Ohio.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many disabled ex-service men taking vocational training have been
assisted by the Department of Commerce in mapping out their careers for
work incident to that of the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Department of Labor has been of very great assistance in aiding
the Bureau to find employment objectives for disabled ex-service men
undergoing training or who have been rehabilitated by the U. S. Veterans’
Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>This will give you a general view of the relation of the U. S. Veterans’
Bureau to the Executive Departments of the government. The U. S.
Veterans’ Bureau naturally must have a close contact with the Congress.
Congress continually calls upon the Bureau for data and information which
can only be obtained from the other Executive Departments of the government
but which immediately relate to the work of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>Inasmuch as you Gentlemen are essentially interested in hospital
administration, I should like to speak briefly on the question of hospital
records, and what data the Bureau is required to have when it is called
before Congress relative to Appropriations. As you know, Congress makes
one appropriation to the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau for Medical and Hospitals
Services. Sums from this appropriation are in turn allotted to the U.S.
Public Health Service, the War and the Navy Departments, the Interior
Department, and the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer’ Soldiers. When
the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau is called before Congress for every appropriation
it must show specifically how the money has been allotted, for what
purposes it has been allotted, and the result accomplished.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_811'>811</span>It has become imperative for the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau to have
available comprehensive records concerning all hospitals in which there
are being treated its beneficiaries. It is not sufficient that these
records be only those concerning the admission and discharge of patients
and the physical examination report in each instance, but equally fundamental
data concerning the results of treatment, periodical turn-over
of patients, the hospitals’ administration, and of equal importance, but
from a different angle, the cost of operation with the resulting per
diem cost per patient.</p>

<p class='c010'>A considerable part of the records on patients, their flow in and
out of hospitals and similar data are available or can be made available,
the value of these data so derived, of course, will be proportionate to
the accuracy or thoroughness with which the records of admission and
discharge are prepared and transmitted. The report of admission and discharge
of patients and the report of physical examination are at present
the only reports common to all Government Hospitals. The necessity for
the prompt rendering of accurate admission and discharge reports and
physical examination reports in all instances is apparent. Such reports
are of very great importance to the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau, for upon
them is determined the medical rating of the hospitalized beneficiaries
and any delay or omission in the rendering of records of this character
reflects upon the administration of the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to the individual hospital operation costs, until very
recently the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau has been operating in the dark on
unit costs. It is demanded that the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau have complete
knowledge of the cost of operating all government hospitals, not merely
as a gross item, but classified by purpose of expenditure and by department
of hospital for which spent. The reason for this point is made
two-fold—First, that the Bureau before it can allot money to the several
services for hospital expense, must be in a position to know for what
purpose the money should be disbursed; and second, because the Congress of
the United States is holding the Bureau accountable for all moneys
appropriated to it and unless this Bureau can tell Congress in detail
this money has been spent, or is to be disbursed, our hospitalization
program will be jeopardized until such information can be secured.</p>

<p class='c010'>The per diem rates for hospitals of the several services vary
materially so far as our estimates are concerned. The degree to which
such a variation in rates is only an apparent variation due to the different
bases upon which they are calculated is not at present ascertainable,
but it should be. Not only should this Bureau know what it costs
for its own patients at any one institution, but it should know the per
diem cost over a given period for all the patients hospitalized there. The
cost to this Bureau affects not only our appropriation; the cost to the
service operating the hospital, including this Bureau’s share, but it
affects the U. S. Treasury. If the cost of maintenance of certain hospitals
is excessive, it would be poor business not to evacuate that
hospital, if other conditions made it practicable, or if impracticable to
attempt to reduce its operating cost.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_812'>812</span>Recently the U. S. Public Health Service inaugurated a system of
cost accounting by individual hospitals. With the perfection of this
procedure the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau will be in a position to talk intelligently
about operating costs with these hospitals whether by departments
of hospitals, purposes of disbursement, such as salaries, repairs,
etc., or by unit costs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The U. S. Veterans’ Bureau looks forward to the time when similar
data are available and regularly submitted by the War Department, the
Navy Department and the National Homes for Volunteer Disabled Soldiers,
not merely as reimbursements due certain appropriations, but by actual
disbursements of detailed purpose of not only for this Bureau’s share,
but for total operations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The U. S. Veterans’ Bureau also maintains contact with the various
miscellaneous Departments and institutions of the government. Time will
not permit of going into any details or of mentioning these contacts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The U. S. Veterans’ Bureau when viewed from its huge task of running
an insurance company with over three and one-half billions of insurance
in force, of making payments on 149,000 insurance claims each month,
making payment on 204,000 compensation claims each month, with approximately
29,000 ex-service men and women undergoing hospitalization, and
having caused to be made over 1,000,000 medical examinations and responsible
for 104,000 disabled ex-service men undergoing vocational training,
representing a task which calls for the closest cooperation and assistance
from every department of the government and only by having the closest
cooperation possible will the government, through the U. S. Veterans’ Bureau,
be able to discharge its obligations to the host of disabled ex-service
men and women of this country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bureau has always enjoyed the fullest cooperation from the
various departments of the government and knows that the same cooperation
will be extended with unstinted measure in the future, to the end that
every pledge will be redeemed concerning the care and treatment of the
defenders of this Republic, and to the end that this administration will
go down in history as an administration that did not forget its sick and
wounded soldiers, and brought peace and contentment to every fireside
where assistance on the part of the government was requested and was due.”</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL JAMES A. MATTISON, N. H. D. V. S, gave the following discussion
of “Economy of Administration in U. S. Veterans’ Hospitals”:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The subject is so broad that we can only consider certain phases
of it within the time allotted for this paper. We all recognize that
there are certain fundamental essentials which must of necessity be
provided in every hospital regardless of the number of patients cared
for. This necessarily means that overhead expenses of an institution
hospitalizing small numbers of patients will be out of proportion to
those of a hospital caring for a large number.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_813'>813</span>The general business management, the purchasing of supplies and
equipment, the conservation and dispensing of the same, the elimination
of waste, etc,. will be considered only casually for the purpose
of emphasizing the importance of adhering as closely to strict business
methods as is done in the case of every successful business man,
whether he be a hospital executive, a merchant, or a man in any other
line of business.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this connection, it might be said that a mistake which is made
in many government institutions, and one which is not made by the most
successful business men, is to attempt to start on economy at a place
where one can least afford to economize, that is in the pay and allowances
of the personnel immediately responsible for the management of
the institution, the responsible heads of departments, etc. In other
words, we are not always willing to pay for brains, a price commensurate
with the business responsibility involved. Again when we have been fortunate
enough to secure the right man the right place, we do not always
recognize his value by paying him a price commensurate with the value
of his work. Furthermore, when we have made the mistake of getting the
wrong man, who in reality is receiving a greater compensation than his
services are worth, and one who, in reality, is a very expensive employee,
we oftentimes make the mistake of not recognizing inefficiency and
promptly correcting it,</p>

<p class='c010'>In case there is any decided handicap along the lines of inefficiency
in the responsible personnel in the administrative, utility, service
or professional departments, it should be promptly corrected, as it
is to those in such petitions to whom we constantly look to be on the alert
in recognizing the short comings of all subordinate personnel.</p>

<p class='c010'>In visiting our own or other hospitals we promptly recognize the
presence or absence of evidence of the proper vigilance or efficiency in
every department. In case of a tour of inspection of one of these institutions
there should be found spurting steam valves, leaking water faucets,
extravagant use of electric lights, overheated buildings, garbage and
swill tanks running over with waste food supplies, evidence of lack of
organization and co-operation on the part of the personnel, professional
or otherwise, we should immediately recognize the fact that there was
inefficiency existing in the personnel of such an institution, and as
a result of this, a decided lack of economical and efficient administration.
Finding such conditions in other departments, we should expect
to find unsatisfactory conditions when the patient population was reached.
We should expect to find histories poorly written or not written at all,
patients waiting over-time for special examinations or special treatments,
lack of accurate laboratory and X-ray records, etc. The matter of such
inefficiency and consequent poor administration on the part of the personnel
in any institution would naturally lead to great dissatisfaction on the
part of the patients of such an institution and to the greatest lack of
economy on the part of the administration, of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_814'>814</span>In connection with the professional department proper, again the
attainment of the most satisfactory results from the standpoint, both
of economy and efficiency, is dependent upon the capacity and co-operation
of the responsible personnel. There has been much discussion
in regard to the number of professional personnel doctors, nurses, attendants,
etc., and on this subject there has been apparently wide
differences of opinion. However, these differences have been based
upon differences of viewpoints of what the actual conditions to be met
were.</p>

<p class='c010'>A definite agreement has been reached in regard to the required
personnel, nurses, doctors, attendants, social service, workers, etc.,
to each two hundred patients in a hospital caring for all acute patients,
whether they be major surgical, acute active neuro-psychiatric, active
tuberculosis, or other type of acute condition requiring active, constructive
treatment.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a matter of fact, however, we all know that in none of our
Veterans’ Hospitals, especially the larger ones of 500 to 1000 or
more beds, are all the patients or even a majority of them represented
by this type of patients, on the contrary we have a large group of
convalescent patients who require professionally very much less attention
from the standpoint of active constructive treatment, dietetic attention,
etc., and hence require vastly less personnel, and the expense of their
maintenance in the hospital will be very greatly reduced from that of the
acute type. Again, we have another group which represents the semi-domiciliary
type, many of whom require very slight constructive treatment,
and yet they belong to a type of patients who are capable of being
finally rehabilitated and restored to an earning status in life. This
group requires still less care than the former, and naturally less personnel
and proportionately less per capita cost to the institution caring
for them. Lastly, we pass to a purely domiciliary group who are to a
large measure permanently disabled and are, therefore, many of them,
to be permanent charges oh the Veterans’ Hospitals. The great majority
of the latter group will require little or no special treatment, but will
require only general care and maintenance. In this group we are dealing
with a type who will represent the minimum per capita cost.</p>

<p class='c010'>As time goes on we shall realize, especially in our larger hospitals,
that the above condition will exist to a larger and larger measure and
the necessity of a very close checking system and a very careful classification
of the patients along the lines indicated above will be a matter
of the very highest importance.</p>

<p class='c010'>This does not mean that as long as special treatment along any line
is needed that each patient will not have such expert examinations, care
and treatment as his condition calls for. Quite the contrary, the most
careful and competent examinations should be directed by hospital units
composed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_815'>815</span>of the most competent staff of men including surgical; medical; ear, nose
and throat; X-ray., etc., at such intervals as the condition of the
patient calls for. It will be by this system alone that we are to keep
a check on the progress toward recovery of each individual patient and
prevent an undue accumulation of a domiciliary group. By proper cooperation
of such a group with the rehabilitation section, many men may be
selected as suitable persons for rehabilitation in the vocational schools.
The importance of this we all realize as there is a certain percentage
of patients who will be quite content with their state as long as they are
receiving complete maintenance and a liberal compensation of from $80 to
$150 per month and no cares and no responsibilities to assume in life.
That is we should be constantly on the alert to prevent making permanent
residents or charges of any man who can be restored to an earning status
in life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Contrast, if you please, with the conditions in our hospitals
the patient in private hospital, who is paying from $10 to $50 per
day for private nursing, hospital accommodations, etc., and a correspondingly
high rate for special professional services, and who in addition
to this is losing heavily because of his absence from his personal business.
In the latter case there is a much greater incentive for getting
well, a greater incentive for requesting that special nurses and other expenses
be cut off at the earliest moment it is found that they are no
longer needed and for the additional request that they be discharged
from the hospital as early as possible after the maximum benefits from
hospitalization have been received. In the one case, the private
patient is paying freely a large sum of money to get well. In the other
case, the patients of our Veterans’ hospitals in many cases are paid liberally
for being sick.</p>

<p class='c010'>In making the above statement, we do not wish to be misunderstood.
We all know that we have among our patients in the Veterans’ Hospitals
some of the best type of men anywhere to be found; some of the most ambitious;
some who are exceedingly anxious to have their health restored
and be returned to an earning status in life at the earliest possible moment;
but, unfortunately, this does not apply by any manner of means to
all the patients whom we are hospitalizing.  Out of the disabled arising
from an army of nearly five million men, naturally there will bob up
representative types of every manner of man in existence. As representatives
of Veterans’ Hospitals we owe to our Government as well as to our
patient our best efforts to help, not only toward the rehabilitation of
every soldier who can be rehabilitated but we are also obligated to help
develop this program upon the most economical basis without sacrificing
efficiency and the most satisfactory constructive results.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_816'>816</span>MR. BURKE: stated that the subjects were now open for discussion, and
called on Colonel Patterson for a few words.</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL PATTERSON, of the U.S. Veterans’ Bureau,: stated that it had been
a great personal loss to him that he had been unable to attend all of
the meetings. He then spoke on the policy of the Veterans’ Bureau with
respect to the utilization of contract hospitals and Government institutions.
He stated that the Bureau has been for some months endeavoring
to take the beneficiaries of the Bureau out of contract institutions
and put them into Governmental institutions for several reasons—first,
the law says we must utilize to the maximum extent the Government facilities
in existence. Another reason is that the majority of contract
hospitals are unsatisfactory from the treatment standpoint, if from no
other reason, as many of these contract hospitals are purely boarding
houses which originated merely for the purpose of making money out of
the Government, by taking care of beneficiaries of the Veterans’ Bureau.
Of course there are many contract hospitals in which this is not true, but
it has been determined that better treatment at least equal cost can
be obtained in the Government hospital. Another reason is that the
civilian hospital is not particularly interested and does not desire to
make the necessary reports. He also mentioned discipline. The contract
hospitals do not like to discipline a man because it may lead to the
loss of that patient. He stated that every time the Hospital Section
of the Medical Division recommends the closing of a contract hospital
the Bureau is immediately bombarded by letters from Congressmen, Senators,
the American Legion, United Veterans, and other organizations, but the
Veterans’ Bureau has been trying to stand firm.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next subject he took up was the fact that a beneficiary gets
more compensation while he is in a hospital. This, however, cannot be
changed except by Act of Congress, and the Medical Division has recommended
to the Director that the man’s compensation be reduced while he
is in the hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>He took up next disciplinary regulations. With regard to payment
of transportation, he stated that this money could not be deducted
from the man’s compensation without Congressional action.</p>

<p class='c010'>He spoke also on the fact that under the Vocational Rehabilitation
Act a man discharged with a disability not connected with the service,
who has been denied compensation, can get training even if his disability
is the direct result of his own misconduct, and that he is entitled
to treatment for any disease contracted while taking training
if it interferes with the continuance of his training. The Medical
Division recommended some time ago that Section 3 training be discontinued
and that no man be given training unless his disability is the
result of service or aggravated thereby.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said he hoped that the gentlemen present would express their
opinion as to whether or not meetings similar to this one should be
held annually.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_817'>817</span>With regard to the attitude of the Veterans’ Bureau towards the
various Services, he stated that when allegations are made all the
Veterans’ Bureau can do is to send them to the Head of the Service,
asking him to take the usual steps to find out whether or not those
things are true. On the other hand, if there is a charge a man is mistreated,
the Veterans’ Bureau must investigate it. It is a very peculiar
situation for one Department to investigate something conducted in another
Department.</p>

<p class='c010'>Regarding complaints, he cited one case. A letter was received
from an insane man in the west Roxbury Hospital, who signed the letter
“All the patients in the hospital”, and complained about everything in
the institution. A letter was immediately received from a Congressman,
then another, and one from a Senator. The institution had been inspected
only ten days previous and the Veterans’ Bureau was sure the allegations
were not true, but sent out another man to investigate the matter. Later
the Bureau received copies of similar letters which the insane man had
sent to President Harding, King George and the Prince of Wales. He mentioned
this as an illustration of what the Veterans’ Bureau has to put
up with.</p>

<p class='c010'>Speaking about coordination and cooperation, he mentioned the fact
that the Public Health Service is represented in the Veterans’ Bureau by
Dr. Guthrie, Dr. Lloyd and Dr. Long, the Navy by Commander Garrison and
Commander Boone, and the Army by Colonel Brooke and Colonel Hutton. In
this way the Bureau benefits by the advice of these men, and friction
between the Departments is avoided.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another thing he took up was the situation in Arizona. Attempts
have recently been made to get the Bureau to put hospitals in two towns,
Phoenix and Tucson, both of which he stated were so hot that everybody
would have to get out in the summer. There are 431 vacant beds at
Prescott, within 400 miles, and in a few months 422 more will be available.
Transportation has been offered these men to these hospitals but
many have refused to go. He believed that the Veterans’ Bureau could do
more than this, but wanted an expression of opinion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c018'>MR. BURKE: asked for further discussions on the questions raised by
Colonel Patterson.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. KLAUTZ: stated that he would like to ask Col. Patterson whether the
question of furloughs has been taken up in connection with disciplinary
regulations.</p>

<p class='c018'>COLONEL PATTERSON: informed him that length or frequency of furloughs
had not been determined, but permission to be absent will be obtained
from District Managers under policies issued by the Central Office from
time to time. He asked for an expression of opinion on this subject.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_818'>818</span>DR. KLAUTZ: stated in regard to the situation in Arizona that probably
all the hospitals available there were situated in an altitude of
5000 ft.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. PATTERSON: informed him that Camp Kearny is lower than this. He
stated that the policy of the Veterans’ Bureau in regard to tuberculosis
has the backing of the National Tuberculosis Association,
and that the men asking for hospitalization had been offered transportation
to Kearny or Prescott.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. KLAUTZ: offered the suggestion that somewhere in the mountains
North of Tucson there might be places which were not too high and
would be good all the year round.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. PATTERSON: reported that there are already at Prescott 131 vacant
beds and within four months will be 432 additional. Why should we
go to additional expense when we have these other hospitals?</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. LONG: took up the subject of the speeding up of patients in hospitals,
which is necessary for two reasons—first, in the interest of the
man himself, and, second, in the interest of economy. The average
man was about 25 years of age when he entered the service, and it
should be taken into consideration that his character had not been
formed, and that keeping him in a hospital tends to destroy still
further his initiative, so the sooner a man gets out of the hospital
the better it will be for him. As for economy, it costs about $240
a month to keep a man in a hospital. He stated that dispensaries are
now being established in the district and sub-offices, where treatment
can be obtained, thus a man should be discharged as soon as he
has reached the maximum improvement. He cited the case of Palo Alto,
where arrangements had been made with Dr. Wheate that when a man had
reached the maximum hospital improvement such further treatment as was
needed should be obtained in the out-patient office. In about six
weeks the total number of patients was reduced from 540 to 417.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. ELLIOTT: took up the question of furloughs, stating that at the Naval
Hospital in Washington at Christmas time many Veterans’ Bureau patients
asked for leave, and pursuant to advice from the District Manager
they were given the same amount of leave that the other Naval patients
received, from 5 to 10 days.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. DEDMAN: spoke on economy. He said he understood a certain rate per
diem was to be established for the care of patients, and wanted to call
attention to several things in this connection. First, the environment.
Some hospitals have central heating plants; others have stoves. He
said that his hospital was an old cantonment hospital, with a unit
heating system which required the employment of about 45 stokers.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_819'>819</span>Another thing, some hospitals Are a great distance from markets; also,
prices may be higher. All those things make quite a difference in the
average cost of the care of a patient per day.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to General Order 27, he called attention to the clause
which gives the Medical Officer in charge the privilege of giving the
man his transportation back to his home, and mentioned the case of a man
who come to the hospital from Oteen, where he had been discharged for
disciplinary reasons. The hospital could not admit him, but authority
was obtained from the Veterans’ Bureau to admit him for examination, and,
if active, to hospitalize. The man was examined and found to be inactive.
He then complained to the American Legion because they did not hospitalize
him, and he had no way to get home. However, in this particular
case, transportation was later received from the Veterans’ Bureau.
General Order 27–A now gives the Medical Officer authority to pay transportation.</p>

<p class='c010'>He then asked whether a man who had been discharged for disciplinary
reasons and was very sick should be hospitalized.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. PATTERSON: informed him that General Order 27 has ample authority for
emergency cases.</p>

<p class='c018'>CAPT. BLACKWOOD: expressed his appreciation of the opportunity to attend
the conference, and of the great value it had been.</p>

<p class='c010'>He mentioned the fact that the word “discipline” carries with a
feeling of dread. Discipline is purely and simply obedience, and
when you have obedience you have discipline. Orders should be issued
in such away that no antagonism will be created. He gave an example:
In the Naval Hospital the patients are all supposed to stand at attention,
if able, when the Commanding Officer comes thru the wards. The Veterans’
Bureau patients objected most seriously to this, so an order was issued
that they should sit down, and now you couldn’t make them sit down.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stated that with regard to the question of absence of a patient
over leave for seven days, under G.O. 27 a man can now stay away six
days without any action other than minor punishments, which he said is
absolutely ridiculous. He thought some other form of punishment, should
be devised, as reduction of compensation would not affect many of the
patients who are not receiving compensation, and believed the Commanding
Officer should be allowed to assign these minor punishments. He did
not believe the patient should be discharged, as in that case he would only
go to another hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another thing he suggested, with reference to medical records,
was that a skeleton record, at least, of the history of a man’s treatment,
his examination and diagnosis, should be made to follow him around
from place to place. This would save a great deal of work and give the
hospital a line on what has been done for the man in the past.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_820'>820</span>He said patients had been hospitalized anywhere from one to thirty-five
times prior to coming to his hospital, and it was impossible to
get a history of their previous hospitalization.</p>

<p class='c018'>HON. CHARLES H. BURKE: I happen to be, as some of you may know, at the
head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>In listening to the discussion this morning by Mr. Madden and
by General Dawes, I have had brought to my notice that there are some
things in connection with hospitalization that compare in some respects
with some of the things I have to come in contact with in connection
with the administration of the affairs of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Madden referred to the politicians and the harm they may do
by criticism and comment and so forth. I don’t think he meant when he
said politicians, the men who may participate in politics. I think he
had in mind these demagogues and agitators and sources of propaganda
that are doing more harm in the Government service,—I know it is
true of the Indian Bureau,—than anything else or everything else
all put together; and I think something of that applies to the hospitalization
question. Agitators, I call them. Some of them are perhaps
interested in the Indians and in their purposes, supersensitive, possibly.
Others have selfish motives that they desire to serve; others are just
ordinary trouble makers.</p>

<p class='c010'>So, in the Indian Service, one of the things that we are handicapped
by is this aggregation that I have just described, that are
criticizing and finding fault with practically everything that is being
done. One of the things that they contend for more than anything else
is that the Federal Government, in supervising and administering the
affairs of the Indians should, before they put into operation any
policy for their uplift and their advancement, have the consent of the
Indians. What an absurd proposition! When you contemplate sending
your boy to some educational institution, are you going to permit him
to dictate and say to you what you shall do, or, when he selects a
certain institution and tries it for a few weeks, say that he does not
like it and is going to try some other institution? How far would a
father get with a son if he permitted him to dictate and dominate the
situation?</p>

<p class='c010'>So it seems to me that this question of hospitalization and caring
for the ex-service man is very largely a medical question and it ought
to be administered with a view to what will be most productive in
rehabilitating and restoring these men to full health; and so it occurred
to me that before this meeting adjourns, and because possibly
the impression may have been given this morning that the principal
question was one of economy, that we should, just for a moment,
consider this other question of what can be done and what should be done
for the best interests of these ex-service men.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_821'>821</span>It will require regulations; it will require legislation.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you have not been repaid in the other sessions of this
Conference until this forenoon, I think every one of you who has
come from some distance will feel that he has been fully compensated
in listening to the discussion by General Dawes and Mr. Madden with
reference to what the Government, under our present Chief Executive,
is endeavoring to accomplish in the matter of administering Government.
And so we have this hospitalization proposition and all of the
Departments having to deal with that subject. We have this Federal
Board of Hospitalization made up of representatives or the heads of
these different departments.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now what I want to ask you gentlemen, and I am talking to you
now as experts, as men who are in the field in charge of hospitals,
in a position to see this Question from every angle,—what can you
do now that will help the situation. This is what I want to bring
to your attention: that is, that each and every one of you, through
your proper officers, communicate freely and from time to time what
you believe ought to be done to strengthen and improve this service;
and then, these suggestions coming from every part of the country
and all of those different institutions and services will be concentrated
and ultimately have consideration by the Federal Board
of Hospitalization, and a regulation will be prepared where needed
and necessary legislation will be suggested to Congress in the
interest of better caring for and administering these different
hospitals throughout the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>My opinion, gentlemen, is this: that when a man goes into a
hospital he is presumed to be ill and should be governed by such
regulations and by such control as will best enable him to recover
from his disability at the earliest practicable time; and if he
ought to have considerable money and if he ought to be permitted to
go his way, let him go; but if, on the contrary, he should be required
to live within certain reasonable discipline as to his
personal conduct, if he should be limited in the amount of money
that he should have to spend as he desires he should be limited by
you, who are expert and who have no possible thing in mind except the
welfare of these men.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now don’t get the impression that you can get all the legislation
that you think perhaps you ought to have. I am not going to
speak of the Congress as constituted now, because a person in the
administrative side of the Government and in a bureau is not supposed
to talk about the Congress and so I am not going to say anything
about the present Congress; but up to about six years ago and for
a period of many years, I happen to know that there were men in
Congress that don’t measure up to what my friend, Mr. Madden, said
a member of Congress ought to be.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_822'>822</span>There used to be members of Congress who kept their ears very close to
the ground listening constantly for any criticism, for any comment on
any part of the Government service, perhaps through a magazine or newspaper;
and they rose on the floor in their might to denounce some policy
or administrative action on the part of the Government simply because
they lacked the courage of their convictions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Madden does not come within that class of members of Congress.
He is a man who has always been known to have the courage of his convictions.
Perhaps the entire body is now made up of that type of members,
but such was not the case up to 1915.</p>

<p class='c010'>These agitators that I have spoken of, these demagogues, have
learned what you can do with a scared member of Congress, and we used
to say that the thing that emphasized most a scared Congressman was
two. We don’t have them I think any more.</p>

<p class='c010'>My friends, let us hope that Congress is so constituted at the
present time, and we will assume that it is, that it will courageously
and fearlessly and without any regard as to what the results may be to
themselves, rise up and respond to what you gentlemen, through the
heads of these various Departments and the Federal Board of Hospitalization
may indicate and will enact into law such legislation, and if
there are any in the Congress who may have any fears about the results
if they do so act, I would say to them they have less to fear by keeping
courageous and standing for what is right, regardless of the comment
at the time, or the criticism that may come from certain sources.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gentlemen, I thank you for the privilege of these few words and
I hope that all of you and each of you will be generous and diligent in
communicating, whenever you have any suggestions to make with reference
to bettering this service, in order that they may have the consideration
of these co-ordinating Departments that were so ably described this
morning by General Dawes.  I thank you.</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. SAWYER: General Ireland, have you anything to say?</p>

<p class='c018'>GEN. IRELAND: I don’t believe I have. I think it is time well spent
and I trust that there will be further meetings of this kind.</p>

<p class='c018'>ADMIRAL STITT: I can only repeat what General Ireland has said. I
have learned a great deal from this Conference and feel sure that
everyone agrees that we should have a similar Conference, possibly
every year.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL CUMMING: I have nothing to say except to express what I know
is the appreciation of everybody here to you as Chairman of the
Board for having inaugurated such a Conference, and, secondly, I
think we owe something to Colonel Forbes as an agent for having brought
us all together.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. MATTISON, N.H.D.V.S.: I can voice the sentiments just expressed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_823'>823</span>I expected this meeting to be exceedingly valuable and it is vastly
more so than I had ever anticipated. I am very glad indeed to have
had this opportunity.</p>

<p class='c018'>DR. WHITE: I want to express my personal appreciation for having had
the opportunity of coming into personal contact with all of you men
who are engaged in this work. I have long felt that one of the
very great values of a congregation of this sort is that resulting
from personal contact with men who are doing the same work.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have listened to all of the discussions. I don’t know what
I have learned, but I feel, as I go back to my desk, that during
the coming year I will, in my various decisions, hark back to something
that has been said here that will help me solve the questions
of the day. The real things that one learns on occasions of this
sort it is almost impossible to formulate in one’s mind at the moment
but they are always brought up and proven valuable day by day.
Thank you very much, gentlemen, for the privilege of meeting you and
I am going to ask you to come out to St. Elizabeths and visit with
us.</p>

<p class='c018'>COL. PATTERSON: I have already occupied a great deal of time and so
I can only voice the sentiments expressed by the previous gentlemen.
I know those of us in the Bureau have learned a great deal and I hope
that it will be possible to let us have the benefit of a similar
Conference next year. We in the Bureau will be in a much better
condition to profit by your suggestions than we are this year and
we will know better where we stand than we do at present. Most of
us are rather new to the job and are in a very receptive mood.</p>

<p class='c010'>In passing I would like to tell Captain Blackwood that the new
order, G.O. 27, covers most of the things he brought up. Some of the
other suggestions as to the way patients got into hospitals I fear
will take some time to rectify. We are in the hands of our agents
in the field. Many of them are not up to the standard. We hope
to rectify that. As far as the hospital question is concerned, I
think you understand that the Medical Bureau is with you and I hope
you will take to heart what Commissioner Burke has said and give
us in writing the benefit of your opinions and send them in through
your chiefs. I hope you will give that your attention and let us
have the benefit of your advice. We want constructive criticism
and we need your help.</p>

<p class='c018'>GENERAL SAWYER: How many of the Commanders present are accompanied by
their wives. Those that are, please stand. (Six stood up) I
want to say furthermore that the reception at the White House is at
8:30; entrance by the North Portico. I feel sure that I can predict
for you a very pleasant evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>In summarizing, just in a few words, I would like to give you
something of an idea of the impressions that have come to me and I
believe that you will agree that they are fair and that you should
accept the same impression for yourself.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_824'>824</span>First, it has been a great delight to me, personally, to meet you
Commanders of these various hospitals. I have a very much better idea
of the kind of men that are caring for these institutions and wish to say
to you that I am more than pleased with the capacity and the efficiency
that you demonstrate. Your contact here with each other has helped you
very greatly. To me the whole hospital question is visualized in a
much broader way. I thought I had a fair conception of what this proposition
meant, but I must say I have enlarged my horizon very materially.
As for myself I have received an inspiration such as I have never had before
to make of this hospitalization subject a matter for consideration
and of engagement of a much higher type. With the idea of its immensity,
with a better understanding of many of the details and requirements
and difficulties, I myself go forth to the undertakings I have before
me as the Chief Coordinator of this Board with much more determination
than ever before, with an ambition that has never quite possessed me
before, so I feel that I myself have been very greatly benefited.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are some things you will take back with you out of this
crowded program. As the days come and go you will have the experience
of referring to this Conference as having given you new light and as having
given you an assistance you hardly record today.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is my own wish that we may be able to put in the hands of each
of you quite extensive minutes of all of these proceedings. If I can
bring that about in the course of a reasonable length of time, you shall
be possessed of such a record.</p>

<p class='c010'>I wish to thank the speakers for conforming so regularly to the
suggestion as to time limit. I wish to thank you for the care with which
you have prepared your papers and presented them. I wish to thank those
of you who have participated in the discussions. I want to express my
appreciation of those of you who have listened so intently and apparently
with such interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>I would be unfair to the occasion if I did not express my gratitude
for the assistance that has been given us by the nurses in their association
with us here.</p>

<p class='c010'>One thing I would have you do. You are but single representatives
of the institutions from which you come.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be somewhat selfish if you were to go home and bottle up
within yourselves the experiences that you have had here and the observations
you have made. Now, fellows, let me tell you what to do: Go
back to your various fields. Call in your associates and your assistants,
take up your whole administrative family and try to inject into them a
little of the enthusiasm, a little of the spirit, a little of the determination;
give to them some of the ideas you take away from here.</p>

<p class='c010'>I want you to go while you are still under the influence of the inspiration
of the occasion, and I want to urge that each of you, as soon
as you get home, take up with your administrative family the various things
that have been discussed here, and try to instill in them the same renewed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_825'>825</span>earnestness and enthusiasm that you possess this evening, and convey
to them for us, this Board of Hospitalization and the great President
of this United States of America, Warren G. Harding, the assurance
that he appreciates every effort that you are putting forth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Coming from a doctor’s family, he realizes more fully than you
can possibly guess the difficulties that are confronting you every day;
and be assured that when you act upon your best judgment that you will
find him standing by whatever you may have regarded as necessary to the
bringing about of the end-results in this war veteran’s case.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me emphasize once more that the concern that the Administration
has is not how you may entertain them while they are in the hospital,
is not how easy and sympathetic you may be with them, but it is how you
engender in them a spirit of determination to get back into the world
again as productive citizens. That is your job.</p>

<p class='c010'>In closing, let me say that at the suggestion of Colonel Patterson
and the Veterans’ Bureau which we are serving, that we are hoping that
somehow before another year shall have passed around that we will have a
real place to which we may invite you to participate in the most interesting
program that could possibly be produced. Fellows, I thank you
for your presence.</p>

<p class='c018'>COMMANDER BOONE: I am sorry we are not able to raise our glasses
to a toast to the Chief Coordinator and the members of the Federal
Board of Hospitalization. The least we can do is to stand for a
rising vote of appreciation.</p>

<p class='c010'>All stood up.</p>

<p class='c010'>The meeting adjourned at 4:45 P.M.</p>
